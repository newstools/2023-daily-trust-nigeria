The actress denied the allegation and pleaded not guilty. Following her not guilty plea, her counsel, Adenike Goncalves, prayed the court to grant her client bail pending the hearing and determination of the case. Goncalves also urged the court to remand her client in EFCC custody pending the perfection of the bail terms if so granted by the court. The prosecutor, in his response, submitted that bail was at the discretion of the court, praying that in the event bail was granted, the conditions of the bail should be such that would enable the defendant to be present during trial.
