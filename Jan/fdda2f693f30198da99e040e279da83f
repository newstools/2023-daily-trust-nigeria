A foundation working for the betterment of life for orphans and the less privileged, Alkhairi Foundation, has distributed 1000 cardigan jackets to 1000 orphans and the less privileged in the Hotoro area of Nasarawa LGA of Kano State metropolis. Speaking while distributing the clothes, the chairwoman of the foundation, Comrade Rukayya Abdurrahman, said it is towards reducing the difficulties of the orphans and less privileged especially during the cold weather. She said most of the beneficiaries were children who may be easily affected by the intense cold currently experienced in Kano. “In order to protect the children against some diseases that can easily affect them, especially the cold, we decided to select 100 orphans and less privileged to benefit from this gesture. From here we are also hoping to expand,” she said. Some of the beneficiaries expressed happiness and thanked the foundation for providing them with the clothes.
