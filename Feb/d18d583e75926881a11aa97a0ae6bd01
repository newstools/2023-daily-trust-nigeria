At least five people have been reportedly killed and seven others injured after gunmen attacked Nagi community in Gwer West LGA of Benue State around 5pm at the weekend. Residents said the attackers earlier attempted to open gunfire on Naka town, headquarters of Gwer West LGA, but were repelled by security forces. They said the attackers fled and later raided Nagi community where the five victims were felled – two women and three men – while more than 50 houses, including the palace of the traditional ruler of the community, were set ablaze. A Special Adviser to Benue State Governor, Paul Hemba, on Friday, confirmed the incident to newsmen, alleging that, “The attack was carried out by herdsmen.’’
