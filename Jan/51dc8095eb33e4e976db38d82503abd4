Edo State governor, Godwin Obaseki, has asked Nigerians to vote for credible candidates who have the capacity to end the avalanche of challenges bedevilling the nation. The governor made the call Sunday in Benin at St. Matthew’s Cathedral Church while speaking with newsmen shortly after the New Year’s thanksgiving service. He said Nigeria would be great again if the various challenges facing it were nipped in the bud by the right leadership. The governor said the forthcoming general elections would present an opportunity for the electorate to make the right choices, adding that it is a year of hope. He asked all registered voters to collect their PVCs ahead of the polls, saying, “2023 is a year to be optimistic about. A year we hope and pray that we can begin to do the right thing for ourselves and our country. “Things are difficult, but we see opportunities, and things must turn around in the state and the country is blessed.”
