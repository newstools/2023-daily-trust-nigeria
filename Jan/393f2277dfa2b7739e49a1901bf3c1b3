The Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC) and Transparency International (TI) Nigeria have urged stakeholders to stop making comments or statements suggesting the possibility of election postponement with less than 44 days to this year’s general elections scheduled to hold on 25th February 2023, and 11th March 2023. Executive Director CISLAC, Malam Auwal Musa Rafsanjani, who is also the TI-Nigeria Chief Executive, said this on Thursday in Abuja. He said postponing the elections would have huge financial implications on the country.

Security personnel and election officials need to be fully equipped to always deal with challenges,” Rafsanjani said.
