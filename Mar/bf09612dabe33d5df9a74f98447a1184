A philanthropist, Zahra’u Nasir Ahmad, has distributed wrappers to 150 women in Shagari Quarters in Kumbotso LGA of Kano State. Speaking during the distribution, Ahmad, who is the Senior Special Assistant on Broadcast to the Governor of Kano State, said the gesture would go a long way in supporting women to enjoy the dividends of democracy as they were sometimes left behind. He noted that women as the backbone of society had pivotal roles to play in ensuring good governance and development, hence the need to always support them. He said, “Women are very important in every society; that is why we decided to do this. I believe they are more than 100; they are about 200, and all have gotten their wrappers. More of this will come in future as we are always committed to supporting women.” The distribution was witnessed by the Councillor of Shagari Quarters Ward, Musulihu Yusuf Ali. The beneficiaries expressed satisfaction with the gift, noting that it would help them as the Sallah period was a few months away. Bilkisu Maitama said, “We really appreciate them for this gesture. Since the beginning of politics in Kano, the women of this area have never gotten anything until now.”
