Ahead of the 2023 elections, the Muslim Students’ Society of Nigeria (MSSN), yesterday said only Allah knows the next set of Nigerian leaders. The students also urged all stakeholders to tackle prevalent challenges in Nigeria so that equal rights and peaceful coexistence prevail in the society. The Amir (President) of MSSN Lagos, Miftahudeen Thanni, made the appeal during the formal closing ceremony of the society’s 113th Islamic Vacation Course (IVC) in the Epe area of Lagos State. The ceremony was attended by the Deputy Governor of Lagos State, Dr Obafemi Hamzat, lawmakers in the state, prominent clerics and other notable personalities. The students’ leader said Nigerians’ patriotism had been weakened by the challenges confronting Nigeria. He noted that “Islam and Humanity” was chosen as the theme of the week-long camping programme to reflect on how Islam and Muslims could be saviours to the myriads of problems facing humanity. The organisers commended the Lagos State government for issuing a circular on the implementation of the Supreme Court Judgement granting the use of hijab for Muslim female students in Lagos schools,  stating that “the act deepens constitutionalism”. if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[300,250],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_3',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0'); Addressing the students, the Deputy Governor of Lagos State, Obafemi Hamzat advised the youth to participate in the next elections, saying their failure to vote was detrimental to good governance. He said many Nigerian leaders have questions to answer before God. He said, “The future belongs to the youths, whether we like it or not, our generation will leave soon, so it is their country, they must participate in the elections that is why they should ask the right questions because 2023 is about capability and ability to achieve their goals and who are the people that can do it for them based on proven records.”
