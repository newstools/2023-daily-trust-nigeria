Arsenal restored their five-point lead at the top of the Premier League with an emphatic 3-0 victory over Fulham on Sunday and carved out a small slice of history in the process. Gabriel, Gabriel Martinelli and captain Martin Odegaard all scored in the first half as the Gunners became the first team ever to win five consecutive away London derbies without conceding a goal in the English Football League. Arsenal began the day with second-placed Manchester City hot on their heels after a 1-0 win over Crystal Palace on Saturday pulled the reigning champions within two points.
