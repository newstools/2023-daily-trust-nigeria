 The Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited has said it is targeting to capture 30 per cent market share in petroleum products retailing in the country. The company’s official stated this at the commissioning of a filling station in Tarauni, Kano State, a statement said. In his remarks, the Group Chief Executive Officer, NNPC Limited, Mallam Mele Kyari, represented by the Executive Vice President, Downstream,  Engr. Adeyemi Adetunji, stated that the project  was midwifed by NNPC Retail Ltd, a downstream business unit of NNPC Limited. According to him, the Management of NNPC Limited remains committed to upscaling the company’s relevance in the global energy community with its drive for sustainability hinged on renewed commitment to partnerships that deliver sustainable value and integrity. Describing the station as a strategic initiative geared towards boosting the nation’s energy sufficiency levels, he assured that it will make petroleum and allied products available and affordable, just as it would provide relief and job opportunities for the people of the state. Kano State Governor, Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, at the event said it was yet another step in increasing NNPC Limited’s growing petroleum downstream asset portfolio and fulfilling its mandate of providing energy security for the country. The station, which is to be known as NNPC Standard Station, Tarauni, boasts of a huge forecourt, which can accommodate 50 vehicles with six pumps and 12 nozzles at a time. It also has non-fuel features such as a mini mart, lube bay and vehicles diagnostics centre, as well as shops for other activities.
