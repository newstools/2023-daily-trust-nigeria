A fire outbreak has razed shops at a popular commodity market, Singer Market, in Kano State. The fire, according to eyewitnesses, started mid night, but it couldn’t be controlled until around 8am. Firefighters alongside marketers worked to bring the situation under control and quench the fire from spreading to other places. One of the marketers, Abubakar Aminu, whose shop was burnt, said he received a call from gatemen around 1:15am, but when he arrived at the market around 2:00am, his shop was ablaze and he could not slavage any goods. According to him, the fire spread to three more plazas housing over 100 shops stored with goods worth millions of naira. “Honestly we have lost a lot. My neighbour whose shop was also burnt to ashes stocked three trailers of goods yesterday night. They are all gone now,” he said. Basiru Dauda Kunya, who is at the scene of the incident, also said, “The house is called Gidan Sojoji and has about 10 shops in front and warehouses inside.
