The National Directorate of Employment (NDE) has trained and empowered 26 Plateau youths with starter packs to establish businesses. The youth were earlier trained on Environmental Beautification Training Scheme (EBTS), landscaping – hard and soft as well as Plaster of Paris (POP), for a period of three months. Mallam Ibrahim Abdulazeez, state coordinator of NDE in Plateau, who disbursed cash and work tools to the trainees in Jos, said the items would assist them to establish their businesses, adding that the beneficiaries were trained to join the pool of entrepreneurs. He said 10 of the beneficiaries were trained on hard landscaping, eight for soft landscaping and eight for the POP.
