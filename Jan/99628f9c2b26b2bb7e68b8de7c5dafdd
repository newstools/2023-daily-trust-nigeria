Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has approved work-free days for public servants to collect their Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs) before the January 29 deadline. A circular signed by the state Head of Service, Hakeem Muri-Okunola, declared work-free days for public servants according to their grade levels from January 24 to 27. “To this end, Mr Governor has graciously approved some work-free days to enable public servants to collect their Permanent Voters Cards from their respective local governments/local council development areas.” Accounting officers and public servants were therefore urged to ensure compliance in preparation for the forthcoming election.
