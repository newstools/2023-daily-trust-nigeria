The Football Association (FA) are investigating Arsenal’s celebrations following Reiss Nelson’s dramatic stoppage-time winner against Bournemouth. Arsenal fought back from two goals down to overcome Bournemouth at the Emirates on Saturday, with Reiss Nelson’s powering home the decisive strike in the 97th minute. The goal sparked chaotic scenes, with members of the Arsenal coaching staff and substitutes flooding onto the pitch to join in with the jubilant celebrations. But referee Chris Kavanagh included the incident in his post-match report before sending it off to the FA and the English game’s governing body is now looking into what happened as a matter of course. Arsenal have yet to receive any word from the FA about a potential charge and have not yet been asked to provide any observations about what went on. But that could still happen, as FA rules state that players and staff should always behave in a ‘responsible manner’ on the touchline and that they should not go onto the pitch without a valid reason, such as the club’s physio going on to treat an injured player. Arsenal have already been hit by two FA fines this season, both were over the conduct of their players for the way they protested to the match official over penalty appeals in games against Newcastle and Oxford.
