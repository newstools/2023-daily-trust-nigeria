The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with one of Nigeria’s leading sports promoters, Ratels Sports Development Foundation (RSDF) for grassroots sports development in the FCT. The Permanent Secretary of the FCT, Dr. Olusola Olasade, while signing the MOU with RSDF in his office yesterday in Abuja, said the organisation had contributed immensely to sports development within and outside the FCT, hence the need for collaboration between the two bodies. According to Olasade, the MOU which is aimed at school sports development will help in unearthing budding talents who would be nurtured to represent the FCT at national and international competitions. On his part, the President of RSDF and proprietor of Nigeria Women Professional Football League (NWPFL) side, Ratels Football club, Barrister Paul Edeh, reeled out some of the objectives contained in the MOU and stressed that the new partnership will help in achieving the objectives of School Sports programmes of the FCT. He said “The importance of sports development in schools across Nigeria cannot be overemphasized.  This is because the best place to catch and groom youngsters early is through regular sports activities in the school system. “RSDF as a result-oriented sports development organization dedicated to solving sports issues through innovative programmes by forming connections between people, resources and ideas believes that this collaboration would build the enthusiasm of students to be inclined towards sports and help them perform better academically. Edeh, therefore, gave assurances that RSDF would carry out its part of responsibilities under the MOU, bearing in mind the aim and objectives of the programme. The target for the School Sports Festival is boys and girls in Primary, Junior and Senior Secondary Schools in the 6 Area Councils in the FCT.
