The Apapa Command of the Nigeria Customs Service yesterday said it collected the sum of N1.023 trillion as revenue in 2022. The Controller of Customs, Apapa Area Command, Malanta Ibrahim Yusuf, made the disclosure while briefing newsmen on the activities of the command in 2022. This figure is about 16.07 per cent higher than the N870.4 billion the command collected in the same period in 2021. The figure is over 35 per cent of the revenue target of N3.02 trillion for the service in 2022. He said the command also processed export cargoes with a Free On Board (FOB) value of 68.5 million dollars, about N28.2 billion in 2022 from non-oil commodities. In all, agricultural cargoes top the list on the export chart for the year under review. He said items exported through the Apapa Port last year include steel bars, agricultural produce such as hibiscus, sesame seeds, cocoa, cashew nuts, ginger, soya beans and mineral products.
