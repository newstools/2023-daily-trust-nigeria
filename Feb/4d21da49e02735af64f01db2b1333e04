Vice President Yemi Osibanjo, yesterday urged the Nigeria Labour Congress to assist in the mobilization of citizens to obtain their Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs) as well as mobilizing them to vote during the upcoming election. The Vice President stated this in Abuja Tuesday when he spoke at the Nigeria Labour Congress’ 13th National Delegates’ Conference held at the International Conference Centre of the nation’s capital. While commending the congress for remaining resolute and united in its struggles he  stated that politicians banking to feed on division among Nigerians were living in the past, saying they will all fail in their mission. “The Congress is a veritable Pan-Nigerian institution. This is a critical edge that the NLC must not lose. The fact is that, despite the busy rhetoric of demagogues, and the utterances of those who profit from disharmony, Nigerians do not hate each other. “Every day, millions of Nigerians unite by their common causes and problems and common issues. That’s common cause and forges friendships across several fault-lines, departments or businesses to engage in philanthropy, and to advance their political goals. “They are trading, intermarrying, migrating across this guidance to better livelihoods, in our markets, in our motor parks. In Nigeria, identity has emerged that transcends ethnicity and religion. “Politicians, who continue to traffic it in division and discord are behind the times and have failed to take note of how much more integrated our society has become. if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[336,280],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_3',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');“I submit to you that it is the elite of our leisure that must adjust them to this reality accordingly. We are obviously not as united as we shouldn’t be, but national integration is a journey. And we’re further along that journey,” he said.
