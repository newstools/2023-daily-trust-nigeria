France and Manchester United centre-back Raphael Varane has announced his retirement from international football. The 29-year-old, who won the World Cup in 2018, scored five goals in 93 appearances for his country after making his debut in 2013. The last of his caps was won in the 2022 World Cup final, in which France were beaten by Argentina on penalties. “Representing our great country for a decade has been one of the greatest honours of my life,” said Varane. Varane, who signed for United from Real Madrid in August 2021, is the latest Les Bleus player to retire after the World Cup.
