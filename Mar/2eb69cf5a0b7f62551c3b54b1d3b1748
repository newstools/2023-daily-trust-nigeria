The Labour Party (LP) has denied any agreement to work with the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kwara State for the forthcoming governorship and house of assembly elections. The chairman of the party, Mr Lanre Ajiboye disclosed this during a telephone chat with Daily Trust on Saturday. The PDP through its chairman, Hon Babatunde Mohammed on Thursday, had said the party was “working together with other opposition parties in Kwara to form an alliance to vote out APC”. It should be recalled that the PDP failed to win a single elective seat during the last presidential and national assembly election contrary to expectations. However, the APC won the presidential, senatorial and house of representatives seat according to the announcement of the results by INEC.

What the PDP is stating is a lie, they didn’t discuss it with us. We discovered that some impostors among us held meetings with them on the issue in the name of LP. But we are not part of it. “The LP is going for the election and we have not discussed it with any party, no party has also discussed it with us. We are not against collaboration with any party but that directive should come from our national secretariat which is not the case now”, he added. On his part, the SDP chairman in the state, Abdulazeez Afolabi, told our correspondent that “As of now, the PDP or anybody has not approached us for any alliance for the forthcoming election.”
