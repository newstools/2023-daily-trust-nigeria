Muhammad Mustapha, the governorship candidate of Social Democratic Party (SDP) in Nasarawa State, has said that he has assurance of the winning governorship election in the state. Mustapha in an interview on Channels TV’s Sunrise Daily said the APC led administration in the state did not offer anything to the citizens. He said, “The people of Nasarawa State have already spoken by giving me this mandate; by giving the SDP mandate. From the National Assembly elections, I have two senators out of three and two house of representatives members out of five. This has already proven that we are only waiting to be swore-in. “You can see that the people of Nasarawa State are actually yearning for change. The reason I have National Assembly members is because people are tired of administration of the governor of Nasarawa State. 10th NASS: Race for leadership hots up as lawmakers-elect get return certificates Tuesday We’ll challenge N/Assembly results in court – SDP “People will go for SDP because they are tired of APC, PDP they want to try a new party.” Responding to a question on his chances of winning, Mustapha said, “You see when it comes to the state elections, sometimes it changes from the National Assembly elections. “Even the turn out of the elections what we are expecting to see this time around will be double of the past elections because people actually prefer to come out more in the state elections because it is more closer to them than the national elections. “I assured you we have already done our home work. SDP being a new party in Nasarawa State has already proven that people could identify with it and cast votes for the party. “And I am not new to the system, I was candidate in 2019 with the APM and today all of us decided to move to SDP. That is to say the wind of power has already been blown. I assure you we will take over Nasarawa,” he said.
