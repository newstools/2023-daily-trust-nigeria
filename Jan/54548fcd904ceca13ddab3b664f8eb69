The Police Service Commission (PSC) has ordered all police officers who are due for retirement to proceed immediately without further delay, saying “there is an institutional succession plan in the Nigeria Police”. The commission through its spokesman, Ikechukwu Ani, on Tuesday maintained that there can never be any leadership vacuum in the force if anybody retires. It insisted that it is the statutory government executive body with the constitutional mandate to recruit, promote, dismiss and exercise disciplinary control over persons holding offices in the force, except the Inspector General of Police.
