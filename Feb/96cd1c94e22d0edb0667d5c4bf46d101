Former world No 1 Daniil Medvedev captured his 16th career title on Sunday with a tough three-set victory over in-form Jannik Sinner in the Rotterdam ATP final. Medvedev triumphed 5-7, 6-2, 6-2 over his Italian opponent who had won the Montpellier tournament last weekend. The 27-year-old Russian took his career head-to-head record against Sinner to 6-0 and will return to the world top 10 on Monday. “I first came here in 2018 and I straightaway loved it,” said former US Open champion Medvedev. “I love coming back here. The last two times I played here were terrible and I’m happy to make it better this year.”
