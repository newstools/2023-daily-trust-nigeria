An 81-year-old woman, Patricia Nkansimuo, has described yesterday’s presidential and National Assembly elections as peaceful and a remarkable improvement on previous polls. Nkasimuo, from Agulu Community in Anaocha Local Government Area of Anambra State, said the turnout and conduct of the electorate and the security personnel were impressive. The octogenarian said: “I have come to vote once again because I want a new Nigeria. The country has been badly messed up and we expect that the new leaders that will emerge from this process will have the capacity to reposition the country. “We have suffered a lot in the past few years and we hope to see a new dawn. I have just cast my vote. This is a remarkable improvement. People came out well. The turnout is impressive. People came out to exercise their civic duties despite the insecurity in the land. Voters flee polling units as Boko Haram strikes in Borno PWDs express mixed feelings over treatment at polls “I must commend the Federal Government and INEC on the use of the new technology. It made the whole process seamless and easy and will curb a lot of irregularities. The BVAS worked effectively. It has not happened this way in the history of our elections. “The turnout is impressive. This shows people are beginning to see elections as a process whereby they will put in place leaders who will better their lots.”
