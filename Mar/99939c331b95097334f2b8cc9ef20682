 INEC has dropped the name of Adegboyega Adefarati, the son of a former Governor of Ondo State, late Adebayo Adefarati, from election winners’ list because of a “court order”. Adegboyega sought to represent Akoko South-East/South-West Federal Constituency in the 10th National Assembly. A Federal High Court in Akure, had nullified the nomination of Adegboyega as APC’s candidate for the constituency. The court, on February 17, declared that the APC’s primary election which produced Adegboyega was null and void. Segun Ategbole and John Adanike, who were aspirants in the primary, had approached the court alleging infractions in the exercise while seeking to be declared winners in separate suits. Justice T. B. Adegoke restrained the APC from conducting another primary since the days remaining were shorter than the 180 days allowed by the Electoral Act 2022.
