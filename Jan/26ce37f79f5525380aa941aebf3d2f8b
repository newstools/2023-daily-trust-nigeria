Labour Party Presidential Candidate, Peter Obi, has said women are more productive and less corrupt than  men. Speaking during a townhall organised by Channels Television on Sunday, Obi promised to bring more women into government if elected as president. “I can say it without anything; women are more productive in Nigeria than men any day any time. I worked with them when I was in the banking industry, they saved the bank. When they believe in anything they go for it.” “I wish our men will do the same thing. And they (women) are less corrupt; they are easily satisfied with little. Men will just go on and on forgetting that it is public money they are taking. I am very sorry about that, men. I am one of you but I have to say the truth of what I observed,” Obi said. Obi&#8217;s endorsement: Obasanjo made a big mistake, says Lamido Tinubu: Atiku sells everything, Obi is stingy The former Anambra State governor recalled how he appointed women into key positions during his 8-year tenure in the state. “As governor, I was about to set up a ministry of men’s affairs because women took over. It is simple, go and verify. As governor of Anambra State, my Chief of Staff, the Permanent Secretary of Government House, the commissioner for finance, the Accountant General, the Head of Service, the Commissioner for Youths and Sports, the Commissioner for Education, the Commissioner for Local Government were all women; they took over.” The LP chieftain promised that his administration will be made up of mostly women and youths because they are hungrier to change the country positively.
