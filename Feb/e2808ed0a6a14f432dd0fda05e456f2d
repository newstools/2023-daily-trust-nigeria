An unnamed governor got N500 million worth of new naira notes from a bank, according to Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State. In an interview with BBC Hausa Service, El-Rufai said politicians who are targets of the naira redesign policy already have their way. “It is not wrong to change currencies, every country do but you can not change it at this season of elections and give this limited time, where in this world that ever happened?” “Politicians and big businessmen who are targeted by the policy have their ways of accessing the new notes, some of them own the banks, but what of poor, petty traders?
