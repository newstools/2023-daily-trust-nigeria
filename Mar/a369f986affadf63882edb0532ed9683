He is the next Buhari, potentially.” The son of Kaduna governor is known for expressing his views on social media. His elder brother, Bello, was elected into the House of Representatives to represent Kaduna North Federal Constituency. Bello, who ran on the platform of the APC defeated Peoples Democratic Party’s Samaila Suleiman, who currently represents the constituency at the lower chamber of the National Assembly. Samaila had defected to PDP when he lost his reelection ticket to Bello.
