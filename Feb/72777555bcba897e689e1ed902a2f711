The FCT Police Command is set to deploy 17,401 personnel for the presidential and National Assembly elections on Saturday. The Commissioner of Police (CP), Sadiq Abubakar, disclosed this at a media briefing on Thursday. He said the command had divided the territory into nine sectors, with each of the sectors to be manned by an Assistant Inspector General of Police (AIG). Abubakar said the division was to ensure adequate coverage of all parts of the territory, especially the suburbs and difficult terrains, noting that the telephone numbers of the AIGs would be made available to the public for ease of complaints and information sharing. He further said, “We are ready and will not leave any stone unturned until we see that the process is conducted peacefully.”
