A renowned cleric, Prophet Hezekiah Oladeji says the 2023 election will not hold if it would not be in the interest of Nigeria. But Oladeji who is the General Evangelist of Christ Apostolic Church (CAC) Worldwide, however allayed fears of Nigerians, saying people should not be afraid of the 2023 election. The clergyman who briefed newsmen in Lagos on Thursday on its annual programme tagged, “the Lagos National Praise 2023” where over 2,500 trumpeters would blow the trumpet, also tasked politicians to play by the rules. He reminded them that power belongs to God, saying, “I believe that a man’s crown will not be given to another. If you do not win today, you will win tomorrow.” Elections will hold as scheduled, Buhari assures Gaya: Lawyers raise alarm over release of suspected killers “As far as the 2023 election is concerned, let’s not be afraid. The Lord who has done it before will do it again.” Prophet Oladeji further urged Nigerians especially the youths not to sell their votes or act as thugs to any politician, saying the end result would not be palatable. “Once you serve as thugs to your age mates, if you are wounded, they will not come and check on you. You are no longer their priority,” he added. He said in this trying time in Nigeria’s socio-political development, Nigeria needs divine intervention to overcome its challenges. He reiterated that God would cancel the 2023 elections if it would not favour Nigerians. He explained that this was the essence of the National Praise programme holding in Lagos on Friday. “We want to appreciate God over Nigeria. God has so much blessed Nigeria. There is a lot of tribulation, there is so much crisis in the world. We don’t have electricity, we don’t have water yet God has been so good to us. “We should praise God. God has been with us. He loves us. God is a Nigerian and I want to say that the greatness of this country would be witnessed by all,” Prophet Oladeji said.
