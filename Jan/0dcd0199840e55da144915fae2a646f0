The Edo State government has disclosed that it will henceforth arrest parents or guardians of pupils found hawking during school hours. The government said such arrests would begin immediately after schools resume on January 9. The permanent secretary, Ministry of Education, Dr Oni Ekhosuehi, who disclosed this on behalf of the commissioner for Education, Dr Joan Osa Oviawe, said the exercise was aimed at checking the menace of out-of-school children in the state. “The Edo State Ministry of Education wishes to inform school owners, administrators, parents, guardians and the general public that the official resumption date for the third term as contained in the 2022/2023 harmonized school calendar remains Monday, January 9, 2023,” she said in a statement in Benin.
