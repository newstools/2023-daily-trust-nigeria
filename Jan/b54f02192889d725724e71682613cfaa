The Edo State government has commenced a two-week training for the state security network on weapons handling and intelligence gathering among others. The coordinator of the Edo State Security Network, Col. Kole Oshoriamhe Omomia (rtd.), said the training will boost the government’s efforts aimed at combating crime and criminality in the state. “This is a two-week intensive training programme aimed to train vigilantes, hunters and other groups in the Edo State Security Network, to have more skills” He said the first batch of the trainees comprised 78 hunters and 580  other operatives of the state security network, adding that the trainees cut across the six local governments of Edo North senatorial district. “The focus of the training includes protection of lives and properties, weapon handling, intelligence gathering; how to know those in their vicinity to be able to identify suspicious strangers; human rights and attitudinal changes, and physical training. He added that the hunters would be trained to be rangers since “they are familiar with the bushes and forests for bush combing.” “Edo North was selected first due to the continuous kidnappings and killings around the axis. Also, being by the border of Edo State and other states, there is a need to fortify the area,” he said.
