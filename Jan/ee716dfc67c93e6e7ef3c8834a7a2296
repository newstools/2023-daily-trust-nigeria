The Presidential Candidate of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), Dumebi Kachikwu, has said that none of the leading candidates in the 2023 presidential election is fit to rule Nigeria. Dumebi Kachikwu stated this during an interview on Channels TV’s Politics Today. Four of the 18 candidates jostling for the highest office in the country are in pole position. They are Asiwaju Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress, Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party, Peter Obi of the Labour Party and Rabiu Kwankwaso of the New Nigeria People’s Party. Kachikwu said that if Nigerians elect the same people who have caused the country serious problems, they would continue to suffer. He said, “In the mid of those who are out there, I have something that will rescue Nigeria. The feeling is that you are running against the major system; but outside it are Nigerians captivated by those who hold them captive. It pains you because even if you earn N50,000 a month it will not last you one week in Nigeria. “On February 25, if we elect one of this these people the media call leading candidates as a president of Nigeria at a time when we all know that our problems are so monumental, Nigerians will suffer. “At a time everybody is saying that no single president will come to solve our problem and we elect the same people who have caused our problem to continue to put out the fire that they have created. “If Nigerians take this for granted, that is when the thing will erupt. People cannot eat anymore. People will keep on leading a dejected life. That is my biggest worry. With the remaining days we have, I call on the media to hold presidential candidates accountable.”
