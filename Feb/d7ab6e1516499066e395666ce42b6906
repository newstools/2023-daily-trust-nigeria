World No 1 Iga Swiatek swept past Liudmila Samsonova for the loss of just one game in the last 16 of the Dubai WTA tournament on Wednesday, earning praise from fellow three-time major winner Andy Murray. The 21-year-old Pole was then handed a walkover into the semifinals when scheduled quarterfinal opponent Karolina Pliskova pulled out with an injury. On Wednesday, Swiatek triumphed 6-1, 6-0 over Samsonova to follow her opening 6-1, 6-1 win over Leylah Fernandez. Swiatek has dropped only eight games in her last six matches, a stretch which saw her lift the Doha title last weekend.
