Two goals by striker Victor Osimhen helped Serie A leaders Napoli to a comfortable 3-0 win over struggling Spezia on Sunday. Winger Khvicha Kvaratskhelia put Napoli in front from the penalty spot two minutes into the second half. Osimhen could have doubled the visitorsâ€™ lead in the 61st minute but his effort was ruled out for a foul on Spezia defender Mattia Caldara. He netted seven minutes later, however, with a close-range header following a mistake by Spezia defender Ethan Ampadu. Osimhen then made it 3-0 in the 73rd minute with his 16th league goal of the season, a personal record.
