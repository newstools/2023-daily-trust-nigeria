The wife of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Titi Atilu Abubakar has led thousands of supporters in a solidarity walk in the streets of Yola, saying Nigerians are eager to vote for the PDP. Women, youths and supporter groups attended the march which started at the Mai Doki Roundabout and terminated at Atiku’s residence on Friday. Addressing a crowd of supporters during the event, Titi urged Nigerians to vote her husband as the next president for a better and prosperous Nigeria, criticising Buhari administration for plunging Nigerians into unnecessary hardship and poverty. She made reference to the naira redesign policy of the Central Bank of Nigeria and the current petrol scarcity as main factors that were making life unbearable for Nigerians.
