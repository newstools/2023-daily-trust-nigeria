Cody Gakpo, Darwin Nunez and Mohamed Salah all scored twice as Liverpool shrugged off a season of frustration to thrash Manchester United 7-0 at Anfield on Sunday. Jurgen Klopp’s men set a new record margin of victory in the clash between English football’s two most successful clubs. Just a second defeat in 23 games in all competitions realistically ends United’s hopes of a first league title in a decade as they remain 14 points adrift of leaders Arsenal in third. The visitors were forced to see off an early onslaught, but still arguably had the better chances of a fractious first half. Ten Hag’s men were then blown away in the second period as Liverpool’s new-look front three finally clicked. Nunez punished sloppy United defending as the Uruguayan stooped to head in Harvey Elliott’s cross. Moments later, Gakpo scored his second with a delightful dink over David de Gea at the end of a lightning Liverpool counter-attack. It could have been even worse for United as Robertson and Ibrahima Konate saw efforts fly inches wide. But Salah got the goal his performance deserved as he crashed in Nunez’s through ball off the underside of the bar. Nunez then headed in his second as he was left completely unmarked from Jordan Henderson’s cross. Salah moved outright as Liverpool’s all-time Premier League goalscorer with 129 with a simple tap in after more shambolic United defending. Firmino then came off the bench to have the final say as he slotted a remarkable seventh two minutes from time.
