The Ward Head of Junction area in Madalla town in Niger State, Alhassan Adamu, has disclosed how a day-old baby was discovered at the premises of central mosque in the area on November 19, 2022, around 5am. He said his attention was drawn by the mosque’s Imam, Malam Musa, that an infant girl was found on the mosque’s premises with her dress stained with blood. He said he informed the village head, as well as the district head of Madalla who asked him to take care of the baby, adding that she had since been named Nihla, meaning Joyous in Arabic. However, two months after, Adamu spoke about his challenges in taking care of her, which include buying baby milk, saying he had bought more than 20 tins already and was finding it difficult buying it.
