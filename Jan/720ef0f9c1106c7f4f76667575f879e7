The Social Democratic Party (SDP) senatorial candidate for Kwara South, Prof. Wale Sulaiman, has pledged that he will institute “free education from primary to secondary school,” if elected. While unveiling his agenda at a news conference in Ilorin, the state capital, the renowned neurosurgeon added that he “will also promote access to primary and secondary school education for all children.” According to him, some parents in the district could not afford to send their children to primary and secondary schools at N1,000 and N4,000, respectively. Suleiman further announced plans to institute a “Kwara South Development Fund” to execute his programmes, including free education.
