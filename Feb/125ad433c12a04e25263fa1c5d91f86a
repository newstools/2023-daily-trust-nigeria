 Nigeria’s non-interest bank, TAJBank Limited, has opened a new branch in Kano in furtherance of the management’s sustained drive to deepen the brand’s penetration across the geo-political zones of the country. The opening of the flagship Zoo Road, Kano branch came barely a week after the opening of the bank’s Apapa-Lagos branch and two days after the listing of its N10 billion Sukuk bond issuance on the Nigerian Exchange, making TAJBank the first corporate to list Sukuk bond on the bourse in Nigeria. Speaking during the Kano branch opening event, the bank’s Managing Director/CEO, Mr. Hamid Joda, told hundreds of businessmen, artisans and individuals who expressed their interest to be among the first customers of the bank, that the management decided to further consolidate on the bank’s operations in the state “To support all Nigerians who desire to have banking services delivered to them at no interest and offer them opportunities to grow their enterprises and meet the needs of their families. “As you may be aware, we just opened our Apapa-Lagos branch a few days ago. Coming to Kano to open this new branch, along with the existing ones here, is a demonstration of TAJBank board and management’s commitment to offering what no other bank is offering now to customers. I want to assure you that, as our operations mantra says, ‘our only interest is you’, our highly valued customers”, he added. Joda said that with the licensing of TAJBank by the CBN to operate nationwide, more of TAJBank’s branches would be opened before the end of the first quarter of the year across the six geo-political zones to deepen the nation’s financial inclusion and by implication, lift millions of Nigerians out of poverty level through customiSed products and services delivery by the bank to its growing customers. Commenting on the strength of the bank in terms of its customer-friendly services, strong Information and Communications Technology (ICT) assets, and highly skilled and courteous staff while opening the branch, Alhaji Ali Balarabe, said the experiences of customers at TAJBank’s branches everywhere attested to the fact that the bank was out to really serve its customers in ways no other bank is doing now.
