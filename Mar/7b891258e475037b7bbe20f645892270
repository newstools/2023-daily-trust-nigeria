The Chairman of the Labour Party (LP) in Rivers State, Dienye Pepple, yesterday announced that the party has endorsed the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Siminialayi Fubara, for Saturday’s governorship poll. Pepple, who disclosed this while reading the text of a communique to newsmen in Port Harcourt, said the decision was unanimous among the party chairmen of the 23 LGAs of the state. This came barely four days after a self-acclaimed governorship candidate of LP in the state, Mr Fafaa Dan Princewill, emerged. Daily Trust reports that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had recognised Mrs Beatrice Itubo as the LP governorship candidate in Rivers. Pepple said the decision of his party to back the PDP candidate was because his senatorial district, Rivers South-East, was yet to produce a governor since the state was created in 1967. He, however, said in the past few days, LP in the state was hit by a major shock. He said someone was claiming to be the party’s candidate and that there was a viral news on social media claiming that Mrs Beatrice Itubo had stepped down for the APC candidate. When contacted, Mrs Itubu said she remained the authentic and recognised candidate of the LP for the March 11, elections in the state. Itubo said already the party’s national leadership had suspended Pepple and his co-travellers. Meanwhile, LP’s National Working Committee (NWC) has dissolved its state executive council in Rivers State with immediate effect. National Chairman of the party, Julius Abure, who disclosed this yesterday in a statement at the end of the NWC’s emergency meeting in Abuja, said the dissolution was as a result of anti-party activities and corruption in the management of the party’s funds. He said, “Those who were at the helm of affairs in Rivers State when our presidential mandate was openly stolen in Rivers State should step aside until full investigation is completed on what happened on that day.”
