Victor Osimhen has admitted he is working towards his ‘dream’ of playing in the Premier League as talk of a Summer’s transfer continues to rumble on. The Nigerian forward conceded his desires in an interview and is quoted by The Athletic as saying: “I think playing in one of the top five leagues in the world (Serie A) is an amazing feeling for me. “A lot of people worldwide consider the Premier League as the best and the strongest league but now I’m in one of the best leagues in the world which is the Italian Serie A.”
