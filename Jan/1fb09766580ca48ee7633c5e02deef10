The Presidential Candidate of the New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP), Rabiu Kwankwaso, has blamed Nigeria’s current situation on the wrong choices made by those ruling the country from 1999 to date. Kwankwaso, who made the remark on Wednesday at the Chatham House in London, lamented that Nigeria was beset by numerous challenges, including high rate of unemployment, insecurity and growing poverty. The former governor of Kano State said while many would hinge the economic hardships facing the country on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and global economic recession, he would hold the past and present leaders responsible. He said, “Our country today is facing numerous challenges – insecurity, growing poverty, growing and uncontrolled inflation, growing unemployment and despondency, decaying infrastructure, high rate of maternal and neonatal deaths, collapsing education system, crises in the health care services, weak institutions, growing corruption and graft, unbelievable theft of crude oil and other mineral resources and growing mistrust among the constituents, communities of our country and so on. 2023: Kwankwaso To Speak At Chatham House Obasanjo: What Prevented MKO Abiola from becoming President “We can point fingers at all sorts of factors allegedly responsible for our situation – from coronavirus to global economic recession; from western powers to international capital etc. But for me, we are where we are because of the mistakes in wrong choices made by the very people entrusted with the business of governing Nigeria in the last 24 years.” According to Kwankwaso, he is aspiring to become the next president of Nigeria because he understands the issues involved, the mistakes made and the wrong priorities set. “Together with our team, we are better connected with hopes and aspirations of Nigeria citizens. We understand, agree with and share grievances and we have a practical plan for addressing every challenge bedeviling our country,” he added.
