Ireti Heeba Kingibe of Labor Party has been declared winner of Saturday’s senatorial election in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Kingibe defeated incumbent Senator Philip Aduda of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) who was elected into the senate in 2011. Declaring the results at the collation center, GSS Garki, Abuja, the returning officer for the Federal Capital Territory, (FCT) Professor Sani Saka, said she polled 202,175 votes to defeat her main challenger, Aduda, who scored 100,544 votes while APC’s Zakari Angulu secured 78, 905 and candidate of NNPP got 3,802 votes. In an apparent, u-turn, the returning officer said only result of Abaji area council remained cancelled now as he certified Bwari area council result after rejecting, it earlier — citing irregularities. Our reporter observed that major party agents at the collation center refused to assent the result.
