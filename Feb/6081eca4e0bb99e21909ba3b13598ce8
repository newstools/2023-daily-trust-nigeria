The Coordinator of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) in Bauchi State, Mrs Rifkatu Yakubu, has advised corps members participating in the 2023 general elections not to accept food from strangers. She gave the advice in Bauchi on Wednesday during a sensitisation of corps members on their role in the general elections. Mrs Yakubu urged the corps members to ensure that they went to their various polling units with food so as to avoid any form of inducement from strangers. She said, “I will advise all those involved in the elections to ensure that they have what to eat. Please, ensure that you equip yourselves properly. Why election violence persist – Former INEC commissioner At final peace accord signing: Buhari urges candidates to accept election outcome “What I ‘m saying in essence is that people may use anything to drug you. You may be sleeping and other things would be taking place without your knowledge.’’ She also urged them not to tamper with or try to adjust the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) machines if they developed technical problems. She said this was because the electorate might think they were trying to manipulate the electoral process which might lead to serious problems, advising them to hand over the BVAS machines to INEC’s technical officials present in the polling units in case of any technical glitch. Also speaking, Mr Ateli Samson, an assistant director from the NYSC headquarters, Abuja, said efforts were made daily to ensure that the corps members were safe before, during and after the elections. He assured them that INEC would make effective provision for their feeding and urged them not to violate any electoral law. (NAN)
