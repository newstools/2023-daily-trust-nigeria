The presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi, has said Nigerians should not vote for a sick person as the next president of the country in the forthcoming presidential election. He said this at his alma mater, the University of Nigeria (UNN), Nsukka, Enugu State on Thursday. Obi described Nigeria as a sick country, saying a sick person should not be elected as its president in the February presidential election. He said Nigerians should not vote for any presidential candidate who cannot stand for 30 minutes. The LP presidential candidate said Nigerians should look out for character and trust in the 2023 general election to avoid plunging the country into “further mess”. Speaking in an interactive session with the UNN Business School students and officials of the institution, Obi said: “This country is sick and should not be handed over to a sick person. “I am not saying that anyone is sick. We have been here for over two hours, we don’t want people who can’t stand for 30 minutes. In the United States during elections, they go for debates; somebody once asked Barack Obama questions that are personal and he answered. “But here in Nigeria, somebody wants to contest an election, we don’t know his real age, we don’t know his name, we don’t know the schools he attended. Nobody knows his real identity and he is pushing to lead everybody. “My name is Peter Obi, I can say I went to CKC, went to the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. Both the VC today, and the DVC today, these are my schoolmates. We came to university the same year and left the same year. “The people I went to school with, I can see them here today; my seniors and my juniors. How come we now have people who do not have classmates. This is very important,” the former Anambra governor said.
