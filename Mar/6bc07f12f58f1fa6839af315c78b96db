A 45-year-old physically challenged man, Faleru Olusegun, has recounted why he decided to go into smuggling of rice and poultry products. The suspect, who is being detained at the headquarters of the Federal Operations Unit (FOU), Zone A, Ikeja, of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), was arrested while he and one other person tried to smuggle bags of foreign rice into the country. The suspect told journalists that poverty and the burning need to do something forced him into crime. He said, “I lost one of my legs after I was shot by armed robbers in our Igbogila village in Ogun State about 10 years ago. “I, therefore, fortified myself with charms that will make me disappear when I run into security operatives.” The Acting Controller of Zone A, Hussein Kehinde Ejibunu,  said “One of the suspects sustained injuries in the process of struggling with my men. He is currently being treated in the hospital. “I will get a remand order from the court to keep the physically challenged man in our custody until judgement is delivered.”
