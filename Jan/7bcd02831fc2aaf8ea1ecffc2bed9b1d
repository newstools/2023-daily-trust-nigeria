The embattled chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kano State, Shehu Wada Sagagi, has said there is no letter from the party’s National Working Committee (NWC) dissolving his executive in the state. The Kano Caretaker Committee of the PDP led by Alhaji Mai Adamu had accused Sagagi of disobeying court order by still parading as the party’s helmsman. But reacting yesterday in an interview with our correspondent, Sagagi said he is a law-abiding party member looking forward to a united PDP in Kano State and refuted the allegation that he disobeyed the court order. He said, “Their problem is that they don’t have the proper legal interpretation or they chose to ignore it. Yes, it’s true the court of appeal has set aside the lower court judgement of Justice Taiwo O. Taiwo. But the judgement said the NWC can go ahead and dissolve the state exco. “Up till now, I have not received a letter from the NWC indicating that my existing executive has been dissolved. Secondly, the fact that we filed an appeal, we approached the Supreme Court and it listened to us and gave us a date, that is not automatic, that judgement at the Court of Appeal stands. “I have informed my lawyers about that allegation and even if they feel I disobeyed the court judgement what they should do is go back to the court and complain not to say somebody is impersonating.”
