The Minister of State for Finance, Budget and National Planning, Prince Clem Agba, has said the introduction of the eyemark monitoring app by the federal government is to ensure government projects are delivered on time through live monitoring of activities done by contractors. Speaking during a sensitisation programme for MDAs yesterday in Abuja, Agba said the ministry developed the application to support tracking various policies, programmes and projects by citizens/citizen groups towards ensuring value for money. He however said since its official launch on March 31, 2022, traffic on the site has been low as only few Nigerians are aware of it and have done one review or the other of the capital projects posted. “Hence the need for the sensitisation Workshop; the objective of the Workshop, therefore, is to educate and enlighten the MDAs on the provision of relevant implementation progress of their projects and programmes to be uploaded to eyemark applications. The dialogue will also sensitise the MDAs on how to review comments and observations made by the citizens and provide relevant feedback,” he said.

The information is to enable citizens to be aware of government efforts to improve their welfare,” the minister added. On his part, the Director of National Monitoring and Evaluation, Dr Zakari Lawal, said the inability of the government to monitor all projects due to limited staff necessitated the application.
