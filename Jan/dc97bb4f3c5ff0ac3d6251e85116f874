El-Kanemi Warriors of Maiduguri are determined to end the unbeaten run of ‘invincible’ Bendel Insurance when they host the Group A table toppers this afternoon in their Week Five fixture of the 2023 abridged Nigeria Premier Football League (NPFL) season. Bendel Insurance in imperious form have won all four matches to remain the only club with a hundred percent record so far this season. Without doubt, leading goal scorer, Imade Osarenkhoe of Bendel Insurance who has scored a goal in each of the four matches is the man to watch in this potentially explosive encounter. However, El-Kanemi Warriors who suffered a slim 0-1 loss at 3SC over the weekend also fancy their chance of ending Bendel Insurance unbeaten run. Meanwhile, Kwara United, Rangers, Wikki Tourists and Nasarawa United who are yet to taste victory this season will be seeking for first victories in their midweek matches. In Group A, Nasarawa United who are having a torrid time will host Plateau United at New Jos stadium which also serves as the home ground of their opponents, Kwara United who were hammered 3-0 by Enyimba will aim for their first victory as they host in-form Akwa United in Ibadan. And 3SC who picked their first win in a slim 1-0 win over El-Kanemi at the weekend will travel up north to battle Gombe United while Remo Stars whose unbeaten run ended after a 3-0 thrashing by Bendel Insurance in Benin City will hope to bounce back to winning ways when they host Enyimba in Ikenne. if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[250,250],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_1',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[250,250],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_2',151,'0','1'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0_1'); .box-4-multi-151{border:none !important;display:block !important;float:none !important;line-height:0px;margin-bottom:15px !important;margin-left:auto !important;margin-right:auto !important;margin-top:15px !important;max-width:100% !important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px;padding:0;text-align:center !important;}Elsewhere in Group B, high-riding Lobi Stars who are yet to taste defeat after their opening day loss at Rivers United will welcome unbeaten Sunshine Stars in Jos, winless Wikki Tourists are in Port-Harcourt where they face an uphill task against reigning champions Rivers United just as Rangers who forced Niger Tornadoes to a 0-0 draw in Kaduna will host Dakkada FC who lost 1-2 at home to Rivers United. After a crushing 0-3 loss to Lobi Stars, Bayelsa United will seek redemption against Doma who forced neighbours Wikki Tourists to a 0-0 draw in Bauchi while Abia Warriors who appear to have lost form seek revival at home against Niger Tornadoes.
