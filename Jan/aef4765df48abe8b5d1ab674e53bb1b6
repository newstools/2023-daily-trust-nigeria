The Industrial Training Fund (ITF) yesterday in Abuja launched the framework for the National Apprenticeship and Traineeship System (NATS) targeted at curbing unemployment and driving economic growth. Director General of the ITF, Sir Joseph Ari, said the scheme if implemented has the potential to drastically reduce unemployment, while also affording the youths the opportunity to earn income while learning, enhance eligibility for financial assistance while on training, and also contribute meaning to the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). He said: “National Apprenticeship and Traineeship System will ensure a structured approach to skills acquisition and certification leading to an increase in the number of MSMEs and the expansion of existing ones, a reduction in unemployment, underemployment, social vices and crime rates, and improvement in the quality of services of technicians and craftsmen. Above all, enriching the National Apprenticeship and Traineeship System with international certification for the various vocational trades will promote balanced employment and competition among our youths, just as it will serve as a viable source of foreign earnings for the country through the export of skills.” The Director General of the Nigeria Employers Consultative Association (NECA), Mr Adewale Oyerinde, noted that the programme would strengthen Nigeria’s business environment and it will be more competitive in the African region and globally.
