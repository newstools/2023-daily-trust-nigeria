A former governor of Bauchi State, Isa Yuguda, has said it would amount to blasphemy for Nigerians to reject the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, as a special gift from God. Yuguda who spoke yesterday during a symposium on ‘renewed hope 2023’, organised by the APC Professionals Forum at the Yar’adua Centre in Abuja said Tinubu should succeed Buhari because he is patriotic and an anti-corruption crusader. The former governor said, “Nobody can doubt the progress in Lagos and we can see the leadership qualities in him to lead people from all parts of the world. “Tinubu is very patriotic and that is who we need today as a leader. He is an anti-corruption crusader. We know it and everybody knows it. If there were corruption in Lagos, that state would not be where it is today. 2 monarchs, 5 others arrested over Edo train station attack Benchers chair asks N/Assembly to remove INEC power to review results “It would be to, should I say, blasphemy to turn against him. At least, he is there for you. Tinubu is very patriotic and that is who we need today as a leader. “Anywhere there is corruption, there can’t be progress; there can’t be economic progress that we can see. In society, we can’t say there is no corruption but, at least, it has been brought down to the barest minimum.” Speaking at the event, wife of the APC presidential candidate, Senator Oluremi Tinubu, said her husband would lift many families out of poverty and hunger if elected on February 25. Tinubu’s wife who was represented by the Director General of National Centre for Women Development, Asabe Bashir, said if elected, the Tinubu-led administration would increase opportunities and create the right environment for women and youth to flourish.
