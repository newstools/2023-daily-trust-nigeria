The Nigerian Navy and the National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure yesterday sealed a pact to produce locally, ships meant for maritime security. Signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) at Naval Headquarters, Abuja, Chief of Naval Staff Vice Admiral Auwal Gambo said the NASENI team had visited the Naval Dockyard in Lagos to refine the Nigerian Navy’s local shipbuilding, construction and fabrications. He said the indigenous shipbuilding effort had enhanced the presence of the Nigerian navy at sea which led to significant reduction of piracy. Gambo said that the efforts had culminated into the delisting of Nigeria from the international list of piracy-prone countries in the world.
