Gunmen have abducted the chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and a community leader in Giwa Local Government Area of Kaduna state. An eyewitness told our correspondent that the bandits invaded Dan Mahawayi village at about 11pm on Sunday and kidnapped the two residents. Those abducted were Alhaji Bala Alhassan Marafa, PDP chairman, Dan Mahawayi Ward and Suleiman Isiyaku Mai siga. “We all assumed they (the gunmen) were part of the campaign trail that toured the area, because it was when the two kidnapped victims returned from the campaign, that they were immediately picked them. This is the first time anybody would be abducted in Dan Mahawayi community,” the eyewitness said. He noted that the bandits had seen patronizing tea joints in the village but never unleashed mayhem to the community until that Sunday night. Efforts to get comments of the PDP chairman of Giwa LGA and the Kaduna state Police Public Relations Officer, Mohammed Jalige, were unsuccessful as their mobile lines were not reachable as of the time of filing this report.
