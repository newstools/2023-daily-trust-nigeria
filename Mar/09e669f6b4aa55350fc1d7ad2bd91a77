The presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP) in the February 25, polls, Peter Obi, has said there must be a paradigm shift for a better and prosperous Nigeria. Obi charged the electorate not to be discouraged by the outcome of the presidential election, but complete what they had started by coming out en masse to vote for the candidates of LP in this Saturday’s governorship and Houses of Assembly elections. Obi, who spoke at the weekend in Benin, Edo State, during a thank you visit to the state, said Nigerians had begun a new movement through LP which no one could stop. Obi is challenging in court the announcement of Bola Ahmed Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress (APC) by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as winner of the February 25, presidential poll. He said, “Nigeria must not be allowed to remain the way it is; there must be a paradigm shift for a better and a prosperous Nigeria. We have begun the journey of a new Nigeria and nobody can stop it. We will not allow Nigeria to remain the way it is. “I am here to thank you for the feat recorded on February 25. Vote for the Labour Party come March 18.” He further said the party would organise a retreat for candidates who emerged victorious in the recently concluded National Assembly elections and the ones to be conducted this Saturday so that they could do things differently and change the political narratives of the country.
