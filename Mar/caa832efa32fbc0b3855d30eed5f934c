A former Minister of Sports and Youth Development, Solomon Dalung, has said he has enough reasons to sue the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) over the results of last Saturday’s elections in Plateau State. Dalung, who addressed newsmen in Jos, on Wednesday, said he contested and lost the Langtang North/Langtang South federal constituency election in the state due to the alleged failure of INEC to fully comply with the Electoral Act. He said, “I contested for Langtang North/Langtang South Federal Constituency, and Iost the election. But the circumstances that characterised my losing the election have compelled me to seek legal redress at the competent court of law. “In the first place, the results declared by INEC are in total contrast with the ones my agents have. That means the results were tampered with along the line.

That of the Senate and presidential were intact, but that of the House of Representatives which I am contesting was short by 600. I allowed the election to go on for the sake of peace, but at the end of the voting, INEC noticed overvoting and had to cancel some votes. The question is, “Where did the ballot used for over-voting come from?”
