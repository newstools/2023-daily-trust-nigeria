The Plateau State Police Commissioner, Bartholomew Onyeka, has created another police divisional headquarters in Gindiri District of Mangu LGA of the state. While commissioning the Police Division on Friday, the commissioner said the creation of the new Divisional Headquarters was to prevent further attacks on communities that have suffered incessant attacks by gunmen. The creation of the new police division comes barely four months after the police commissioner established a divisional police headquarters in Bashar District of Wase LGA of the state following incessant attacks and killings in the area. He said, “Today, policing is community driven. This simply involves making use of what you have to do in your policing work. I had promised that so long as I am here, I will ensure the realisation of the division, and that has become a reality. We need the community’s support to achieve our desired goals. “For the hunters and vigilantes who are here with us, I want you to work with the police to ensure synergy and get rid of criminality in this community.”
