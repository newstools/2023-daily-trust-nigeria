Tank farm owners, including A.A Rano, Emadeb and nine others in the Ijegun-Egba area of Lagos have resolved to sell petrol to marketers at the N172 per litre official ex-depot price. The petroleum product dealers also said they will begin the distribution of 127 million litres of product nationwide from today. This was stated in a communique the members issued after a meeting at the weekend. Last week, NNPC Ltd, other marketers and heads of security agencies met in Abuja and resolved to tackle the petrol distribution crisis which has caused petrol scarcity amidst high prices reaching over N600/l in some states. Some depots were accused of selling above the newly approved ex depot price as seven were suspended by the government in December 2022 over similar acts. In the new resolution, the Ijegun-Egba Tankfarm Owners and Operators Association said it was working with NNPCL for seamless supply of 127m litres of petrol starting today by six members of the association for February. They are AA Rano, EMADEB, First Royal, Shell Plux, Chippet and RainOil. The communique, signed by its Chairman, Mr Adebowale Olujimi, stated: “The tank-farms at Ijegun, Satellite Town, Lagos State play a very pivotal part in petroleum distribution in Nigeria, accounting for approximately 35% national petroleum product distribution. “That, with the expected estimated 127m litres of PMS for our facilities in the month of February 2023, all our members will strive to ensure that the products are loaded and trucked without delay on receipt and discharge into our facilities. This will make the product available for Nigerians. “That our tank-farms will continue to sell and load at the government regulated price of N172 ex-depot to all marketers. That all our members’ retail outlets across the Nation will continue to sell petroleum products at the government approved price,” it explained.
