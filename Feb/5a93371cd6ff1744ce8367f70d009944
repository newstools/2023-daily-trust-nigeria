Victor Osimhen, on Friday, set a first-ever record in the history of Napoli after scoring in the 2-0 win against Sassuolo. The Nigerian striker, who scored in his 6th consecutive game when he netted a beautiful goal with his strike against Cremonese last weekend, went a little further in history. He joined Gonzalo Higuain as the only players to score in six straight Serie A games for Napoli – with that record in the bag, he is now the only one to score in seven straight Serie A games. Osimhen’s goal against Sassuolo made him the first-ever player in the history of Napoli in the three-point era (since 1994-95), to find the net in seven league games in a row.
