The pan-Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere, has rejected the emergence of Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as winner of the February 25, presidential poll. The group said the “lawful votes” cast during the election confirmed that the Labour Party (LP) candidate, Peter Obi, won. This was contained in a communique issued yesterday after its special general meeting at Isanya-Ogbo in Ijebu-Ode LGA of Ogun State on Tuesday. The communique was jointly signed by the acting National Leader and the Secretary-General of Afenifere, Pa Ayo Adebanjo and Chief Sola Ebiseni respectively. The National Publicity Secretary of the group, Jare Ajayi, in a statement, had congratulated Tinubu as the president-elect and urged those not satisfied with the result of the election to seek redress in court, but the meeting denied sending any congratulatory message in the name of the group to Tinubu. Police kill 1, arrest other in foiled bandit attack in Katsina Bandits kill 6, abduct many in fresh Niger attack Part of the communique reads: “The result of the lawful votes at the election available to the Afenifere through credible sources confirm that Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, won the said election, and we, thus, support his decision challenging the contrary declaration by the INEC. “The general meeting hereby denounces in strong terms and dissociates Afenifere from any congratulatory message in the name of the organisation or howsoever to any candidate as illegally declared by the INEC.
