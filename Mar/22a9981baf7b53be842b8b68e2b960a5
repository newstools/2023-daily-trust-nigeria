The Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, has appealed to residents of the state to accept the old notes following the Supreme Court judgement that the old N500 and N1000 notes remain legal tender till December 31, 2023. The Edo State Government is one of the co-defendants with the federal government against Kaduna and some other state governments that urged the Supereme Court to nullify the February 10 deadline for old naira notes set by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).
