Reiss Nelson scored a stunning 97th-minute winner as Premier League leaders Arsenal came from two goals down to beat Bournemouth. Bournemouth had taken the lead after just 9.11 seconds through Philip Billing who scored the second-fastest goal in Premier League history., and went 2-0 up via a Marco Senesi header. However, Arsenal pulled level with goals by Thomas Partey and Ben White, before Nelson struck. The winger, making his first appearance since 12 November, slammed in from 25 yards in the seventh minute of stoppage time. Arsenal’s Premier League lead is restored to five points after they had seemed certain to cede ground to Manchester City, winners over Newcastle in the early kick-off. Bournemouth, meanwhile, remain in the relegation zone after threatening a major upset – and beginning at top speed. Billing’s goal was the second-quickest in Premier League history – only Shane Long, who scored for Southampton after 7.69 seconds at Watford in April 2019, has netted faster. Meanwhile, Wesley Fofana scored his first Premier League goal for Chelsea as the Blues beat Leeds to ease the pressure on manager Graham Potter. His goal ended Chelsea’s run of 396 minutes without a goal when he rose to head home from a corner early in the second half. After a run of just one win in their past 15 games, there was a sense that three points were a must for Potter, despite insisting he retained the support of the club’s owners before the game. Chelsea remain 10th despite the win while Leeds are 17th and only out of the bottom three on goal difference. Similarly, wasteful Tottenham ended a miserable week with a narrow defeat by Wolves after a late goal from Adama Traore stunned the Champions League contenders. Wolves, who are now 13th, had been on the back foot for most of the game but made their late momentum count. Spurs’ inconsistent form continued as they dropped important points in the race for a top-four spot.
