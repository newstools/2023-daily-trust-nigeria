Joao Felix is aiming to reignite his career at Chelsea on loan after underwhelming at Atletico Madrid, whom he joined for an eye-watering 126 million euros ($135 million) in 2019. The Portugal international arrived from Benfica as one of the most expensive signings of all time, despite having played just 26 top-flight games. Atletico hoped coach Diego Simeone could mould the talented forward into the club’s next Antoine Griezmann, whom he was signed to replace. Desperate to fill the void left by the French forward’s departure to Barcelona, Atletico overpaid for Felix and his hefty price tag burdened the striker.
