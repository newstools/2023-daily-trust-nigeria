The complaint against Lira provides specific information regarding persons identified as ‘Athlete 1’ and ‘Athlete 2’,”the statement reads in part. Oduduru’s provisional suspension comes a year after his team mate Blessing Okagbare was banned for 11 years for doping before the commencement of the Tokyo Olympics. According to the statement “In February 2022, a sole arbitrator of the AIU Disciplinary Tribunal concluded that they were “comfortably satisfied” that ‘Athlete 1’ was Oduduru’s team-mate, Blessing Okagbare, and banned her from the sport for ten years, which was increased to an 11-year ban in June 2022 following further charges brought by the AIU.”
