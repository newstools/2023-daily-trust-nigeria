The Inter Party Advisory Council (IPAC) has urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to improve on its performance during the February 25 presidential election and address the shortcomings and complaints raised by political parties and their candidates in future elections. The IPAC made the call Friday in Abuja in a communique at the end of its general council meeting held at the council’s national secretariat, Abuja and signed by its national chairman, Yabagi Yusuf Sani, an engineer, and national secretary, Yusuf Mamman Dantalle. The council noted that election was the beauty of democracy and must be free, fair, credible, acceptable, inclusive and peaceful. The IPAC urged INEC to be adequately prepared for the exercise before embarking on it and if necessary, seek an extension of time to ensure it is properly conducted to meet international standards. The council also commended Nigerians for embracing peace after the presidential election and enjoined aggrieved political parties and their candidates to approach the court for redress. “Council urged the judiciary to justify the confidence the people reposed in it as the temple of justice and last hope of all aggrieved citizens, and adjudicate on all election cases on merit ensuring that justice is not only done but seen to have been done. “As the umbrella body of the 18 registered political parties, the IPAC will continue to consolidate and deepen the country’s democracy, ensure an environment conducive for successful elections, political stability, enduring democracy and wellbeing of Nigerians. Together, we will build a strong, virile, progressive, egalitarian and just democratic nation”, the communiqué stated.
