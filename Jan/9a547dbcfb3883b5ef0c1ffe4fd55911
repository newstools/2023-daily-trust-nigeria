The Plateau State Commissioner of Police (CP), Bartholomew Onyeka, yesterday stormed out of a peace pact signing by the governorship candidates of political parties in the state. Onyeka expressed disappointment when he was invited to give a goodwill message at the Dialogue Reconciliation and Peace (DREP) Centre, Jos, but saw only two governorship candidates in attendance. He expressed anger that he had abandoned other engagements for the event only to find that just two of the candidates were in attendance while three others sent representatives. He stormed out of the venue, saying he would only give his goodwill message when all the candidates were in attendance and requested that the event be postponed. The event, however, continued after a plea from the DREP Director, Rev Fr Blaise Agwom, who said the event should be allowed to continue in order to be fair to those who were in attendance. Those in attendance were candidates of the APC, Nentawe Yilwatda and Mohammed Abdullahi Danbaba of the Allied Peoples Movement (APM).
