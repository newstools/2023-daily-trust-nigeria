The National Directorate of Employment (NDE), under its School on-Wheel (SOW) training scheme, has empowered 10 graduates with start-up tools and equipment in Borno State. The Director General of NDE, Mallam Abubakar Fikpo, disclosed this while handing over the equipment with a cash backing component to the trained beneficiaries in Maiduguri. Fikpo, represented by the state coordinator, Mohammed Muktar, said resettling the youth will reduce the number of unemployed in the society. “Realizing that these four vocations are in high demand in Borno State, we trained many youths to venture into them. Today, we resettled all the 10 in their chosen vocations, and others will follow in batches.
