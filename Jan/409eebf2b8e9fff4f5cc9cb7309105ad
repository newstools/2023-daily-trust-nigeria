The House of Representatives has called on the National Universities Commission (NUC), the Federal Ministry of Education, the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE) and the National Commission for Colleges of Education (NCCE), and other bodies to order all tertiary institutions to suspend academic activities till after the general elections. It also called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to make special arrangements for students to collect their permanent voter cards (PVCs). This followed the adoption of a motion on matters of urgent public importance moved by Rep Kabiru Ibrahim Tukura at the plenary on Thursday.
