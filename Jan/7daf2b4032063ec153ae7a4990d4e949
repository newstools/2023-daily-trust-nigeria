Muslim community of Yolan Bayara area on the outskirts of Bauchi town has written a petition against the Bauchi State government’s move to allocate what they believe is their 470 hectares of land to the Christian community for the purpose of a Christian cemetery. The protest was contained in a petition dated January 10th, 2023 and addressed to Governor Bala Mohammed through the Secretary to the State Government. The petition signed by Sani Sarki Yakubu and six others which was copied to all heads of security agencies in the state, Emir of Bauchi, chairman, Jamatu Nasiril Islam, Bauchi State, and chairman, JIBIWIS, Bauchi State, demanded urgent intervention of the governor to avert the occurrence of a communal clash. Yakubu later addressed a press conference on behalf of the Muslim community at the weekend in Bauchi. In a swift reaction to the petition, the spokesman of Bauchi State governor, Mukhtar Gidado, said the government was yet to formally give out the land to the Christian community, adding that, “Government is still studying the processes.” It would be recalled that last week, the Christian community led by CAN chairman in Bauchi, Rev. Dr Abraham Demius Damina, disclosed that Governor Mohammed had allocated 50 hectares of land for usage as their new cemetery. He stated this in an interview with newsmen at the government house, Bauchi. if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[300,250],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_3',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');Responding, Governor Mohammed had said the interactive session was meant to seek the support of Christians in Bauchi through prayers in the build-up to his second-term ambition.
