The presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi, has said a new Nigeria is possible under his leadership. Obi said this on Monday at the party’s presidential campaign rally in Ilorin, Kwara State. He said, “We have the magic wand to turn Nigeria around. We need leadership to secure and unite Nigeria; that is our number one promise. A new Nigeria is possible under the Labour Party. We don’t want a Nigeria where snakes and goats swallow money. “This year’s elections, they will come to you with religion, tribe and money, but tell them you are hungry. Collect the money they will give to you because it is your money and vote for us.

They have campaigned with umbrellas and brooms for over 16 years now but only achieved insecurity and economic woes. This is the time of the youths. Now go and vote for our symbol, father, mother and child, to connect party politics with the people.” if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[250,250],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_3',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');He said his ticket with Datti would guarantee a proper place for the youths and charge them to mobilise themselves for the elections.
