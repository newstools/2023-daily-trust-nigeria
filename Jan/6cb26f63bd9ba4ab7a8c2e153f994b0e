The digital marketing industry is one of the most competitive niches out there. With so many players and vendors fighting for the same audience, it’s no wonder that affiliates feel the pressure to stand out from the crowd. Understanding useful strategies and how to implement them is great and all, but it’s even better to clutch on to some pearls of wisdom from industry experts. The Head of Content at Zebra Casino, Mary Ndlovu knows a thing or two about the affiliate marketing industry: ‘Without wanting to devalue the importance of affiliate marketing, a diluted way of explaining it would be ‘promotion of products or services that aren’t your own.’ Of course, anyone who works in the sector would understand this is a broad definition, and there’s so much more to it than that. It requires substantial research, knowing your competition, staying ahead of it, and understanding the importance of building and solidifying relationships with partners. Before venturing into the affiliate world you must first build a website, blog or social media channel. Once this is established and executed, the next logical step is to join affiliate programs. The main function of such programs is to provide you with links to showcase and promote on your platforms, which will in turn generate commissions through visitors’ clicks and buys.’  What is Strategic Marketing? This is a process of targeting your specific market segment by creating a unique brand identity for your business. It involves evaluating your brand’s current state and creating a plan to position it in the market so it attracts the right audience. This process requires you to do research on your target audience’s preferences, demographics, and psychographics. You must also determine the best ways to reach out to your target audience and create a lasting impression that compels them to embrace your brand.  Why is Affiliate Marketing So Competitive? Affiliate marketing involves promoting a product or service by referring your audience to an existing vendor. In return, you will receive a portion of the sales proceeds as an affiliate commission. This model is ideal for marketers who want to start their own digital business without having to invest in creating a product from scratch.  With the rise of e-commerce, affiliate marketing has become one of the most competitive niches in the digital marketing industry. There are thousands of affiliates promoting the same product on the same marketing channels. As the result, it has become harder to stand out from the crowd and increase your affiliate sales.  How to Achieve Success in Affiliate Marketing? If you want to succeed in affiliate marketing, you must first understand that your brand and marketing efforts must be unique. You can’t just replicate the strategies that have worked for your competitors. You must create a marketing strategy that is exclusive to your brand.  You can achieve this by understanding what makes your brand unique and creating a marketing strategy based on those strengths. Focus on creating products and content that is highly relevant to your audience.
