The Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami (SAN), on Monday, made an appearance at the National Secretariat of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abuja ahead of Wednesday’s hearing on the Naira swap policy of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) at the Supreme Court. The visit to the party’s headquarters came barely 24 hours after governors who are members of the party met with the National Working Committee (NWC) and asked them to obey the Supreme Court’s order on Naira redesign and swap policies of the CBN. The meeting also asked President Muhammadu Buhari and the CBN governor, Godwin Emefiele to do the same. 3 Kano guber candidates defect to ADP, endorse Sha’aban Sharada JUST IN: PSC bows to pressure, removes Naja’atu from election duty The Supreme Court had ordered the CBN not to implement the February 10 deadline for use of old N200, N500 and N1,000 notes, but the CBN had disobeyed the direction.
