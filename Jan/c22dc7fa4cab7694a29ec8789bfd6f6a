Presidential Candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (#PDP), Atiku Abubakar, has returned from the United Kingdom. Atiku had travelled to Dubai from where he went to the UK for meetings with key government officials. During his time abroad, there were reports that the former vice president was ill and receiving treatment. But Paul Ibe, Atiku’s spokesman, denied this stating that the trip was at the invitation of British officials. Atiku met with UK’s Minister for Development and Africa in the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, Andrew Mitchell, among other key senior UK government officials. He also held a closed-door meeting with the Archbishop of Canterbury, Most Revd Justin Welby, in the United Kingdom. Governors Udom Emmanuel (Akwa Ibom), Aminu Tambuwal (Sokoto), who are key members of his presidential campaign, accompanied him on the trip.
