World No 1 Carlos Alcaraz will begin his season on clay at next month’s Argentina Open after being forced to pull out of the Australian Open with a right leg injury. The 19-year-old Spaniard will be missing the season’s opening Grand Slam event, which begins in Melbourne on Monday, due to a muscle problem in his right leg. “I’m really looking forward to starting my season in Buenos Aires this year, playing in a historic tournament that has been won by great champions,” the US Open champion, who is the first teenager to top the ATP rankings, said in a statement.
