A magistrates’ court in Birnin Kebbi, Kebbi State, has sentenced one Bashar Muhammad Bunza to six months imprisonment for criminal breach of trust, obtaining money under false pretense and impersonation. In a statement, the Kaduna Electricity Distribution Company (Kaduna Electric), said the convict was arrested by operatives of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) for parading himself to electricity customers as a staff of the company and collecting bills for his personal use. The statement revealed that the First Information Report (FIR) stated that Bunza was apprehended by some customers in the Go-Slow area of Birnin-Kebbi, where he collected the sum of N10,000 from a customer in the and could neither provide evidence of payment nor account for the money. The operatives of the NSCDC who arrested him later charged him before a magistrates’ court for breach of trust, obtaining money under false pretense and impersonation. He pleaded guilty to the crimes and was sentenced to six months imprisonment on each charge with the option of N100,000 fine and also to pay the sum of N10,000 as compensation to the victim. Reacting to the judgement, Kaduna Electric’s Head of Corporate Communication, Abdulazeez Abdullahi, welcomed the sentence and said it would serve as a deterrent to others.
