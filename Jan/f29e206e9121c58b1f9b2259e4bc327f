The immediate past public relations officer (PRO) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Murtala Usman Dukku, has formally joined the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP). He joined the opposition NNPP after he resigned as spokesman of the PDP in the state, shortly after he was suspended from the position by the party. Daily Trust reports that Murtala Dukku was suspended by the PDP via a letter from its state secretary, Alhaji Adamu Abubakar, for allegedly working against the party. He, however, resigned his membership of the party a few hours after his suspension through a letter addressed to the party leadership.
