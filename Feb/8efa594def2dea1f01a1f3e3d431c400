The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said that it will not conduct elections in 240 Polling Units (PUs) during the February 25, and March 11, general elections mainly for security reasons. The INEC Chairman, Prof Mahmood Yakubu, disclosed this yesterday in Abuja at a meeting with the 18 registered political parties. He said no new registrants chose the affected PUs and no voter indicated interest to transfer to them during the last Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise, noting that the PUs without registered voters spread across 28 states and the FCT. He said, “All voters who have been assigned to new polling units will receive text messages from the commission indicating their polling units.” Yakubu urged leaders of political parties to continue to call their candidates and supporters to order. Meanwhile, the National Chairman of the Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC), Engr Yabagi Yusuf Sani, said under no circumstance should the coming elections be postponed. He said, “I would like to admonish party leaders that having observed that the elections are conducted free, fair and credible, the results should be accepted for the love of our country.”
