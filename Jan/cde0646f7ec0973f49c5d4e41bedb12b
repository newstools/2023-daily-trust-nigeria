Croatian top seed Marin Cilic has been forced out of the Pune Open in India with a knee injury, the 34-year-old said Thursday, dampening his Australian Open preparations. The 2014 US Open winner had breezed through his first match but withdrew shortly before his quarterfinal appearance at the ATP year-opener after hurting himself during a practice session.
