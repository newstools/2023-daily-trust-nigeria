The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Campaign Council in Rivers State has said its ‘open-air campaign’ will return the party to power in this year’s polls. The director of publicity and communications of the campaign council, Chief Ogbonna Nwuke, in a statement yesterday that the countdown to the PDP’s appearance on the campaign trail in the state has begun. He said, “Early in the week, the PDP in Rivers State released its official campaign timetable. We have barely four days to the commencement of the outdoor campaign of the PDP. “Beginning from Ogba/Egbema/Ndoni Local Government Area on the 16th of this month, we shall go from LG to LG to showcase our candidates and what the PDP will do for Rivers people in the next four years. “Given what has happened in the state in the last seven years and what is still going on today in terms of the execution of well-thought-out development programmes at the grassroots, nobody who has a pure and discerning heart can be in any doubt of the capacity of the PDP to take the state to a new threshold of progress and growth.  “As a responsible and focused political party, experienced in the delivery of good governance, we are prepared to take our message of economic prosperity, social transformation and political consolidation to all nooks and crannies of Rivers State.  “We are similarly ready to share our message of great hope, and outstanding achievements of the Wike administration that eyes can see, with the good people of Rivers State.” w
