The FCT Muslim Pilgrims Welfare Board has directed those who wish to take part in this year’s hajj exercise to deposit N2.5 million with the board pending the release of the actual hajj fare by the National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON). The board, in a statement by its director, Mallam Muhammad Nasiru Danmallam, said such deposit should come in form of bank draft of the said amount and payable to the FCT Muslim Pilgrims Welfare Board, Abuja. Mallam Nasiru said the registration is on a first-come, first-served basis via a bank draft, in line with the principle of fairness. He said the board has so far registered over 40 per cent of its last year’s hajj allocation for this year’s hajj exercise, adding that it has collected deposits from those who want to perform the hajj through the board because of its outstanding services in previous operations.
