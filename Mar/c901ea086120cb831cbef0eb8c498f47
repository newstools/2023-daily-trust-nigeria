Ghanaian import, Paul Acquah, was on fire as he fired a hat-trick to lead Rivers United to a 3-1 victory over Motema Pembe in their Confederation Cup group match played yesterday at the Godswill Akpabio International Stadium in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State. The Ghanaian superstar scored shortly before halftime after he was teed up by Ukeme Williams His compatriot, Emmanuel Ampiah set him up for the second goal 10 minutes after the break. However, substitute Mydo Nakouho Yallet reduced the deficit for the visitors on 78 minutes. Acquah then completed his hat-trick deep into stoppage time to lead the Pride of Rivers to their third win in four Group B games. It will also be recalled that Acquah scored the game-winning goal in the first leg, which took place on February 26 in Luanda. This means he has scored four goals in four Confederation Cup matches this term for Rivers United and is leading the goal-scoring chart. Rivers United’s triumph also restored their two-point lead at the top of the table to nine points after four games. Asec Mimosas are second in the group with seven points, while Pembe are last with two points from a possible 12. In his post-match conference, Stanley Eguma acknowledged that the Congolese side played well but his tactical plans secured the win. “Our opponents played well today but our tactical plans gave us maximum points today,” he said. Stanley Eguma’s side will next face Congo’s Diables Noirs on Sunday, March 19. No Nigerian club has won the second tier league since it was rechristened as Confederations Cup by the Confederation for African Football (CAF).
