 The governorship candidate of the African Democratic Congress (ADC) in Ogun State, Biyi Otegbeye, yesterday, told Governor Dapo Abiodun that no amount of “procured endorsements” will save him from defeat in Saturday’s election. Otegbeye said this in an interview with newsmen in Abeokuta. He spoke against the backdrop of the gale of endorsements of Abiodun’s second term bid by traditional rulers from the three senatorial districts of the state. Otegbeye accused Abiodun of procuring the endorsements with money, adding that the governor had been intimidating the traditional institution into supporting him. He said, “For the incumbent governor, no endorsement will save him because BVAS does not recognise it; it recognises PVCs. You must have a voter’s card; that is what counts.” He described the agro-cargo airport recently commissioned by Abiodun in Iperu area of the state as a “scam”. He said, “The airport is a scam and everybody knows. Airport without a safe runway, airport without a control tower. That is not an airport.”
