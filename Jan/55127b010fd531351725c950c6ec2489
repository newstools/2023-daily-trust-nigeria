The Court of Appeal in Sokoto will today deliver judgment in the appeal challenging the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Zamfara State, Dr Dauda Lawal. Lawal defeated his two opponents, Ibrahim Shehu and Hafiz Nahuche, with 422 votes against their one vote each. Dissatisfied, Shehu approached the Federal High Court, Gusau, which nullified the primary and ordered PDP to conduct a rerun within 14 days. The party complied and conducted the rerun and Dauda Lawal re-emerged, but Shehu again approached the same High Court saying that there was no election. The court ruled in his favour, saying that the PDP has no governorship candidate for this yearâ€™s election.
