The Kano Civil Society Forum (KCSF) has set up a seven-man committee to investigate the alleged negligence resulting to the death of a pregnant woman at the Muhammad Abdullahi Wase Specialist Hospital, Nasarawa, Kano, ostensibly due to lack of cash and delayed payment through bank transfer for the treatment bills. President of the KCSF, Ambassador Ibrahim Waiya, in a statement, said: “Our attention has been drawn to an incident regarding one pregnant woman who lost her life at the Muhammad Abdullahi Wase Hospital because of alleged negligence. “The multiple complaints and calls from different quarters and responsible citizens within and outside Kano are too many to be ignored.
