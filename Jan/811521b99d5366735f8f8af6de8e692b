The Director General of the Atiku/Okowa Presidential Campaign Council (PCC) in Anambra State, Prof. Obiora Okonkwo, has said the PDP candidate, Atiku Abubakar, would grant the detained leader of the banned Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, unconditional release if he becomes the next president of Nigeria. Kanu has been in detention since June 2021, when he was intercepted and renditioned to Nigeria from Kenya by the federal government and faced terrorism charges. However, the Court of Appeal sitting in Abuja, on Thursday, October 13, 2022, quashed the terrorism charges and acquitted him of the seven-count charge. The federal government is, however, challenging the judgement at the Supreme Court. Okonkwo, in a statement yesterday, said Atiku would release Kanu unconditionally if elected president on February 25. He, therefore, urged the people of the zone to throw their weight behind the PDP candidate to win the election. “I am saying this with every sense of responsibility that Atiku will grant Nnamdi Kanu unconditional release. That is in Atiku’s agenda for permanent peace in the South East. if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[300,250],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_3',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');“In addition, he will apply a political solution to release all those genuine IPOB agitators in detention without trial. “Atiku’s government had serious talks with the group and others, with the view to restoring their faith in the country, and making them part of the efforts for a better Nigeria. “However, the criminal elements will be dealt with decisively. What we are now, therefore, saying is that for this to happen, peace must reign for elections in the South East, and the need for the southeasterners to fall behind PDP,” Okonkwo said.
