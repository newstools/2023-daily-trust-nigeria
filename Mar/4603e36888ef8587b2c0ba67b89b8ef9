The Edo State Police Command has warned the state-owned Edo Security Network (ESN), including vigilantes, to steer clear of election duty on Saturday as they are not empowered by law to perform such. The command also vowed to arrest and prosecute anybody arrested for electoral offences during the elections. The command’s spokesperson, SP Chidi Nwanbuzor, gave the warning while speaking on the command’s preparedness for the March 11, governorship and House of Assembly elections.
