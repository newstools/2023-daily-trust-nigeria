Hajia Jumai Ahmed, the North Central Zonal Coordinator of the National Commission for Refugees, Migrants and Internally Displaced Persons, has disclosed that the 10,000-capacity lDP camp in Kwara State lacks basic amenities. NAN reports that the camp is located in Patigi, headquarters of Patigi LGA. The official disclosed this on Wednesday in an interview.
