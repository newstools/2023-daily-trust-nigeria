Mikano Motors Nigeria has recorded 400% sales growth in 2022. It also started the year 2023 with fun and celebration, as the organisation last week gave special recognition and rewards to its outstanding staff at a ceremony at their assembly plant, Karameh city along Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. The company’s outstanding workers received awards ranging from the Most Creative staff to the Most Efficient staff of the year. Speaking at the event, the General Manager, Mikano Motors, Ralph Haidar, commended the company’s workers by describing their performance as outstanding during the year 2022. He said, “We are using this event to recognise our staff who have shown commitment and dedication in an effort to take the organisation to the next level. I must confess that our staff performed optimally. “So, this award ceremony is about recognising their efforts, demonstrating team spirit and bonding. We are saying we value their contribution to the success of the company in 2022.’’ Haidar said, “Without them, it would have been impossible for the company to attain the kind of growth we experienced last year. With their effort, we were able to achieve 400% growth on a year-to-year basis. We were the fastest-growing automotive company in 2022 and recorded the highest sales in Nigeria after Toyota. We could not have been able to attain such height without our staff cooperation and team bonding.’’ if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[300,250],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_3',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');“This is a new year with renewed energy.
