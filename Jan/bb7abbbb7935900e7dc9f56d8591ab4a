Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has openly endorsed the Presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, ahead of the February presidential election. Obasanjo made this known in a new year message titled “My appeal to all Nigerians particularly Young Nigerians.” The former president noted that none of the presidential candidates is a saint, but when compared in terms of knowledge, discipline and what they can offer, Obi has an edge. “None of the contestants is a saint but when one compares their character, antecedent, their understanding, knowledge, discipline and vitality that they can bring to bear and the great efforts required to stay focused on the job particularly looking at where the country is today and with the experience on the job that I personally had, Peter Obi as a mentee has an edge.
