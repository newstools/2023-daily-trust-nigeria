Ahead of the February 25 presidential election, the All Progressives Congress (APC) has unveiled a list of 3,973 youth ‘soldiers’ to mobilise votes for its presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. The youth soldiers, known as ‘Jagaban Army’ were compiled by the office of the national youth leader with brigades in the 36 states of the federation and the FCT. Lagos State leads the army with 445 soldiers, followed by Ogun with 235, while Bayelsa has the least number of 44. Kano has 199; Kaduna 112; Adamawa 128; Borno 177; Yobe 136; and Kwara 100, among others. The APC National Youth Leader, Hon. Dayo Israel, said it was false to say that the youth population is behind the candidate of the LP, Peter Obi, adding that no party has an all-encompassing youth structure in all the nooks and crannies of Nigeria like the APC. Meanwhile, the APC National Youth Wing is set to inaugurate its campaign council formed to mobilise youth votes for the party on Friday in Kaduna State. Israel reiterated the wing’s commitment to its pledge to secure 50 million youth votes for the party next month.
