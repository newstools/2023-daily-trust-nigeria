Nigeria’s premier polo club joined the global campaign to raise awareness of breast cancer as part of its Corporate Social Responsibility with the debut of the glittering Cancer Bowl prize which was contested at the 2023 Lagos International Polo Tournament. Lagos Polo President, Bode Makanjuola who thanked the crowd for supporting the Lagos Cancer Awareness campaign, stated that the support of the Pink Polo campaign was toad a meaningful action in the fight against breast cancer which remains the second biggest killer of Nigerian women after maternal mortality. He added that Lagos Polo Club’s decision to lend its huge corporate image to the campaign is to create a robust platform to spark significant national awareness about the disease. Polo Royals report that among the numerous high points of the prestigious polo festival, the newly introduced Pink Polo Campaign for Breast Cancer Awareness was the most singular humanitarian legacy of the just concluded 2023 NPA/GTCO Lagos International Polo Tournament. The inaugural Pink Polo final match who was watched by a full house at the foremost Ribadu Road Polo Ground in Ikoyi saw the Lagos Tharwa team defeat MCO polo team 5-3 to write their names in gold as the first-ever winners of the Cancer awareness campaign trophy. Every year, breast cancer kills more than 500,000 women around the world. In resource-poor settings, a majority of women with breast cancer are diagnosed at an advanced stage of the disease, resulting in low survival rates.
