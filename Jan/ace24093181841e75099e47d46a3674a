African table tennis champion, Quadri Aruna, has parted ways with his Bundesliga side TTC RhönSprudel Fulda-Maberzell to join Russian champion Fakel-Gazprom Orenburg for the remaining part of the 2022/2023 season. Aruna who played for the German side for two years confirmed his transfer yesterday that he would be plying his trade with Russian champion Fakel-Gazprom Orenburg for the remaining part of the season. “I was contacted by the Russian club in October 2022 and they had to write to the management of Fulda to express their intention to have me in their fold. They did that and paid the necessary transfer fee for me to join them this January,” he said.
