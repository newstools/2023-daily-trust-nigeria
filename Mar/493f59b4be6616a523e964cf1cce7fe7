The Chairman of the Teaching Service Commission (TESCOM) in Ogun State, Olalekan Ifede, has condemned the report of school principals extorting students partaking in the West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) in the state. Ifede expressed the government’s dissatisfaction to principals during a stakeholders’ meeting in Abeokuta. Citing the case of a principal in a school in Obafemi-Owode Local Government, he said the unwholesome practices were capable of jeopardising the developmental stride of the Dapo Abiodun-led administration in the education sector. “Education is a formidable pillar of the ISEYA mantra and the government will continue to protect its interest and sanction any erring teaching or non-teaching staff after this warning,” Ifede warned. The TESCOM boss emphasised that the government’s stipulated WASSCE fee remained 19,500 and the present administration would leave no stone unturned to make quality education affordable in the state.
