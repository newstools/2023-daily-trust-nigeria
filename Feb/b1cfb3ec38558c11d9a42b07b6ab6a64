The governorship candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in Ebonyi State, Prof Bernard Odo, yesterday pledged to increase the minimum salary of teachers in the state to N100,000 if elected. He also promised to provide free primary and secondary education and abolish all taxes and levies in the education sector. Odo made the promise at a campaign rally in Kpiri-Kpiri metropolis of Abakaliki. He said, “As governor, no teacher under me in this state will earn less than N100,000. If a teacher is poorly paid, she or he cannot focus on teaching the children effectively as required. “So, education is our number one priority as governor. I will ensure that teachers are well remunerated. “I will also abolish all taxes and levies on education. Our schools from primary one to SSS 3 will return to full compulsory scholarship.”
