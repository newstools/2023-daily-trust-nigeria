 National Senior women’s volleyball player, Jummai Bitrus has expressed her desire to develop a new generation of volleyball players from the North Eastern part of Nigeria while giving back to the society that brought her out of the streets into fame and stardom. Bitrus stated this after the conclusion of the Internally Displaced Persons (IDP’s) volleyball clinic in Yola, Adamawa state. Nigeria’s number 1 Libero said the clinic done at Malkohi IDP Camp is the beginning of the hunting volleyball programme in IDP camps in the North East. “I want to create an opportunity to greatness for the young children in the IDPs. I am trying to give back to the society that brought me out of the IDP camp into stardom. “I am ready to use the Jummai Bitrus initiative programme to develop hundreds of volleyball players in the North East.” “Opportunities don’t happen, you create them. Someone created an opportunity for me and It’s been a dream of mine to do the same for young,” she said. Jummai Bitrus who hails from Adamawa State started out as a player with Adamawa Queens, and rose gradually, first to the National Junior team, then to the highest level; participating at African Club Championships, African Senior Championship and Senior Olympic qualifiers. It will be noted she escaped from the claws of the dreaded Boko Haram terrorists and wandered in the thick forest for days before making it to Burha in Northern Cameroon.
