Addressing the first special media briefing same Thursday at the national collation centre, the INEC chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, reiterated that the procedure for voting as provided in the Electoral Act 2022 clearly makes the use of the BVAS mandatory. He said no voter would be allowed to vote without the PVC, insisting that the ‘no PVC, no voting’ rule subsists. The INEC boss noted that vote buying remains a major threat to the country’s democracy, adding that the commission has worked closely with enforcement agencies to ensure that this is eliminated from our electoral process. “We are convinced that our joint operations before and on Election Day will vastly reduce the prospect of voter inducement, which is not only illegal but immoral. The ban on the use of mobile phones and photographic devices at the voting cubicles is still in place.
