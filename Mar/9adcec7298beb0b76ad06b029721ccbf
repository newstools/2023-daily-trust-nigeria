Vinicius Junior was on target again as Real Madrid closed the gap on Barcelona at the top of La Liga table following a 3-1 win over Espanyol at the Santiago Bernabeu Saturday afternoon. Going into the game, Madrid were on a three-match winless run after drawing against Atletico Madrid and Real Betis in the league and losing to Barcelona in the Copa del Rey. However, the European champions secured their first La Liga win in three matches as they came from behind to beat Espanyol. Espanyol started positively as Joselu put the Catalan strugglers ahead after eight minutes. But goals from Vinicius Jr and Eder Militao turned Real’s fortunes around, and they saw out victory with a late Marco Asensio strike. Real, who are six points off the top with an extra game played, face leaders Barcelona in El Clasico next weekend. Carlo Ancelotti’s usage of Eduardo Camavinga as a makeshift left-back proved unwise as he was beaten on the wing by Ruben Sanchez, who provided the delivery for the opener. Joselu’s first-time finish was his 12th league goal of the season, moving him up the standings to become the division’s third-highest scorer. The result keeps Real Madrid six points within leaders Barcelona ahead of the El Clasico next week.
