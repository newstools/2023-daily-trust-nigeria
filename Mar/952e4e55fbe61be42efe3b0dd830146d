The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) recently released its fourth quarter report that stated that Nigeria’s annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for 2022 rose to 3.10 per cent in real terms, a drop from 3.40 per cent recorded in 2021. The report, which indicated that the economy recorded slower growth when compared to 2021, showed that the growth surpassed the projection made by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2021, showing that the economy would grow by 2.7 per cent. Even though the international money lender raised its projection later in the year to 3 per cent, Nigeria’s economy had to overcome flooding, inflation, and reduced oil production among others to stay afloat in the 3 per cent threshold after the economy tanked to negative growth in 2020. According to the NBS, quarterly growth during the year indicated that Q3 had the highest growth with 3.54 per cent followed by Q4 with 4.52 per cent, Q1 with 3.11 per cent while Q3 had the lowest growth with 2.25 per cent.
