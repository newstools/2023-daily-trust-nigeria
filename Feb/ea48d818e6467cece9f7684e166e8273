Speaking with newsmen yesterday in Abuja after picking the APC nomination form for Kogi governorship election, Senator Adeyemi said for fairness and equity, Kogi West should be allowed to produce the next governor of the state since the two other zones, Kogi East and Kogi Central, had occupied the position at different times. He said among the aspirants that had obtained the party’s forms, he is the most qualified in terms of exposure and wherewithal of turning things around for the better in the state.
