The Presidential flagbearer of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso on Monday visited Kontagora, Niger State in continuation of his grassroots campaigns across the country. Kwankwaso who was in the company of his campaign team members was received by a mammoth crowd of supporters who chanted his name as he waved at the crowd. Addressing the crowd, Kwankwaso said his party has the best candidates in the forthcoming general elections. He urged voters to reject what he termed ‘the old and failed order’ of the APC and PDP because both parties had been tested and they failed the nation.
