Senator Ifeanyi Ubah, representing Anambra Central, has donated 6,000 streetlights fitted with surveillance cameras, 1,000 walkie talkies and trained personnel to the Anambra State Government to boost the security architecture of the state. Ubah handed over the items to Governor Charles Soludo at the FC Ifeanyi Ubah International Stadium, Nnewi/Ozubulu, during the Anambra South Security Surveillance and Information Technology Summit on Tuesday. He said the move was a deliberate alliance between Anambra South Senatorial District and the Anambra government. (NAN)
