Manchester City knocked Arsenal off their Premier League perch as second-half goals by Jack Grealish and Erling Haaland earned the champions a 3-1 victory in a feisty top-of-the-table clash at The Emirates Stadium on Wednesday. City were gifted the lead in the 24th minute when an underhit back pass by Takehiro Tomiyasu was ruthlessly punished by Kevin de Bruyneâ€™s composed lobbed finish. Arsenal deservedly got back on level terms in the 40th minute, though, when City keeper Ederson was punished for a coming together with Eddie Nketiah and Bukayo Saka slotted home the penalty. Grealish then fired in the third in the 72nd minute before Haaland netted his 26th league goal of the campaign to silence the home crowd.
