The Nigeria Solidarity Support Fund (NSSF) has released a compilation of works by young Nigerians titled “Righting Our Story,” a collection of short stories, poems, flash fiction, and essays. The collection is a component of the WeNaija literary competition, an annual flagship event of NSSF designed to mobilize young people in support of a more robust healthcare system. The youth-focused competition sought to give young Nigerians a platform to take part in something inspiring that will have a big impact, as well as a way to empower and upskill them. The Nigerian Social Science Foundation (NSSF) presents 20 insightful insights from extremely gifted young Nigerians that foresee a healthier Nigeria, building on its purpose as an advocacy organization for improving health outcomes in Nigeria. The contest organizers stated that; “Each of the entries published differs from each other, and the content is rich enough that if the reader connects with just one of them, our goal would have been met. If it motivates someone to act and as a result lives are saved, or a challenge in the healthcare system is made right, then mission accomplished,” The opening event included a 30-minute panel discussion designed to highlight deficiencies in openness and accountability in Nigeria’s healthcare system. NSSF intends to use the challenge to increase participants’ capacity in using digital tools and applications to advocate for a stronger healthcare system in Nigeria, while also offering a forum for youths aged 15 to 35 to actively engage in advocacy in the healthcare sector, youth empowerment, and poverty alleviation.
