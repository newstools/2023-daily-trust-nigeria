Court orders INEC to accept Labour Party’s candidates in 24 states 522,000 PVCs uncollected in Edo – INEC The Sultan, represented by the Director of Administration, NSCIA, Arch. Haruna Zubairu, said: “We have much to benefit if we stay together in unity. Let us see ourselves as Nigerians first before ethnicity. Nigerians should go and get their PVCs, conduct themselves peacefully, go to the polling units (PUs), vote with wisdom and according to their conscience and should not be swayed with any other primordial sentiment, but with their conscience, leaving God to do the rest.” Also, CAN president, Daniel Okoh, represented by Most Rev Benebo Fubara-Manuel, said, “Our God is bigger than our understanding of the religion and our ethnic sentiments. Thus, we must respect God and listen to Him and be reminded that only God can give us credible leaders. But we on our part must vote our conscience. We must vote honestly; we must vote prayerfully without allowing our ethnic or religious sentiment to control us.”
