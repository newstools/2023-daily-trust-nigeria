By tomorrow, being Thursday, it will be exactly one month since my wife and two children were abducted. And when they called on Tuesday, they said I should go and sell my car to raise N8m for them before they will release them. “Initially, they asked me to bring N3m, but they suddenly changed and asked me to raise N8m; that even if I should sell my car. If I sell it, it will not be worth N1m.” He, therefore, appealed to security agents to come to his aid in rescuing them. Spokesperson of the FCT Police Command, DSP Adeh Josephine, was yet to confirm the ransom demand at the time of filing this report.
