Remo Stars have maintained their unbeaten run in the ongoing Nigeria Premier Football League (NPFL) season with an emphatic 2-0 win over 3SC in the remaining Week Three fixture played yesterday in Ikenne. One of the two privately owned clubs in the Nigerian topflight, Remo Stars  have successfully carried on from where they left off last season having won their first two matches  and keeping clean sheets on each occasion. It will be recalled that in their opening match of the season, Remo Stars defeated visiting El-Kanemi Warriors 2-0 and moved up north to shock Gombe United 1-0 in the Week Two match played at the Pantami stadium in Gombe. By their victory in the South-west derby, Remo Stars and Bendel Insurance are the two clubs that are yet to taste defeat in the current season. Although the first half of yesterday’s match was a cagey affair, in the second half, the hosts put more pressure on 3SC leading to the much desired breakthrough in the 60th minute when Alex Aghahowa scored an own goal to give Remo Stars the well deserved lead. Ten minutes later, Godwin Odibo doubled Remo Stars lead to ensure 3SC had a mountain to climb. Expectedly, the Gbenga Ogunbote tutored ‘Oluyole Warriors’ fought back to at least reduce the deficit but the defence of Remo Stars thwarted all their efforts. if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[250,250],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_3',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');The defeat at Ikenne has left 3SC without a win since the start of the 2023 NPFL season.
