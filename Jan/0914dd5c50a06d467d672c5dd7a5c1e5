Protesters who are stakeholders in the All Progressives Congress (APC) yesterday stormed the party’s national secretariat in Abuja over alleged fraud to the tune of N1.3bn in the Enugu State chapter of the party. The protesters alleged that the chairman of the party, Ugochukwu Agballah, and the governorship candidate, Uche Nnaji, were involved in a fraud in the state. The leader of the protesters and chairman, Concerned Members of Enugu State APC, Adolphus Ude, who doubles as chairman, Mainstream Enugu APC and pioneer deputy chairman, APC, Enugu State, told newsmen that they were at the secretariat to vent their anger over the matter and asked the party’s national leadership to wade in. But reacting, the Enugu State APC chairman, Agballah, said the claims were untrue, insisting that they were yet to be mobilised financially by the national leadership. “We are yet to get any money. The governorship candidate is the person funding the campaigns,” he said.
