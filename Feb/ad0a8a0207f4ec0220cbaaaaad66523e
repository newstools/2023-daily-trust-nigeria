Residents of Minna, the Niger State capital, have expressed concern over the activities of hoodlums popularly known as Sara-Suka who have been operating at will in the last few weeks. City & Crime gathered that the hoodlums who usually attack residents with weapons last Friday disrupted prayers at the Minna Central Mosque. A witness, Abdulmalik Nuraini, told our reporter that the hoodlums started attacking people shortly after the imam had commenced sermon, forcing the congregation, especially those sitting outside the mosque to run to another mosque for prayers. He said, “I nearly became a victim. The chief imam had started the sermon when these boys started. In fact, many of us had to leave to perform the Jumaat at the Friday Mosque in Dutsen Kura Hausa,” adding that the government needs to take action against these boys before the elections. They will discourage people from coming out to vote.” Another Resident, Fatima Mohammed, said that on London Street where she lived, the hoodlums operated daily. City & Crime gathered that the story was the same in Bosso, Unguwan-Daji, Limawa, Barikin Sale, Kpakungu and Maitumbi areas of the town. The state’s Commissioner for Internal Security and Humanitarian Affairs, Emmanuel Umar, said the police had been informed to go tough with any hoodlum caught disrupting the peace of citizens. Umar said, “Following the recurring attacks by thugs, hoodlums and miscreants coming out with weapons, His Excellency, Governor Abubakar Sani Bello has directed and authorised the police and other security agencies that anyone found with a weapon in a public place destroying public property and attacking the police or any law-abiding citizen must be met with equal force.” He admonished parents and guardians to warn and prevail on their wards to desist from acts of thuggery.
