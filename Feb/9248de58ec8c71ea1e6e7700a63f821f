The Kano State Hisbah Board has concluded an investigation on Malama Khadija Rano who was alleged to have dissolved her marriage and married her daughter’s suitor. This was contained in a statement issued to newsmen by the spokesman of the board, Alhaji Lawan Ibrahim, on Tuesday. The statement reads in part: “Presenting the report, chairman of the committee who doubles as deputy commander in charge of operations of the board, Malam Hussain Ahmed, said the committee found out that the marriage is legal and had fulfilled all the necessary criteria.” Ahmed said Khadija was divorced by her husband and had observed the three months waiting period (iddah) prescribed by Islam, later married a man whom her biological daughter had rejected. He dismissed allegations that she was seeing her present husband while married and instigated her husband to divorce her to marry her daughter’s suitor.
