Malam Abubakar Evuti has been appointed as the Director of the FCT Muslim Pilgrims Welfare Board. Evuti, who has since taken over the mantle of leadership of the board, enjoined the staff of the board to be honest in discharging their duties. Evuti took over the leadership of the board from Malam Muhammad Danmallam, who was redeployed to the Abuja Environmental Protection Board (AEPB) by the FCT Administration (FCTA). Until his appointment, Evuti, who hails from Lapai LGA of Niger State, was the Director of Operations of the FCT Muslim Pilgrims Welfare Board for over four years.
