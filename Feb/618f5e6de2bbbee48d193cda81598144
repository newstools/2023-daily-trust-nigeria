Nigeria’s sole representative in the CAF Confederation Cup, Rivers United will be facing daring club Motema Pembe today as they bid to qualify from group B. Left-back Ebube Duru vowed that the team will not allow what transpired in the game against Diables Noirs to happen again. It will be recalled that Rivers United lost their first away trip in the group to Diables Noirs by 3-0 but only bounced back playing at home when they defeated Asec Mimosa by the same margin to save from pride. Ahead of their match-up against Motema Pembe, the Super Eagles defender reassured that the team will get a result away from home. D’Tigers overcome Guinea to keep World Cup quest alive Nigerian athletes shine at SEC championships finals “It is a very crucial game for us, played 2 games lost one and won one. “Now we are playing against Motema Pembe who are in 3rd position with 2 points and at a neutral ground. Though it’s a home ground for them, it’s not going to be an advantage because they are playing away from home. “We knew what the game is all about and we have spoken to ourselves that we have to come out strong and not allow what happened to us against Diables Noirs to repeat itself, and make sure we get maximum 3 points or at least a point from the game,” he said. A minimum of four points for Rivers United over the double headers will surely boost their chances of qualifying from the group as DC Motema would be left with only three points after matchday 4 while Rivers United will be riding on 7 points. They will need a win out of the remaining two matches (away to Asec Mimosa and at home to Diable Noirs) will berth a quarter-final ticket.
