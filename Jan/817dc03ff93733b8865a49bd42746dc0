The 36 state governments and the Federal Capital Territory have proposed to spend over N11.5trn in the 2023 financial year, an analysis by the Daily Trust has shown. The breakdown indicated that N6.482trn will be spent on capital projects while N4.989trn is for recurrent expenditure. Daily Trust reports that 20 states have already passed their budgets while the remaining 16 are yet to. Those that passed their appropriations include; Lagos, Ogun, Akwa Ibom, Benue, Bauchi, Taraba, Delta, Katsina, Adamawa, Kaduna, Gombe, Osun, Ondo, Kogi, Yobe, Anambra, Kano, Jigawa and Nasarawa. The states have passed their 2023 budget into law as such money to be spent might increase. But experts who spoke to Daily Trust described state budgets as yearly rituals because significant parts of the projections were hardly actualised. In the budgets they presented, Daily Trust reports that only a few of the states explained how they would generate the monies to fund them.

And in the event they are unable to get such loans, the projections suffer. At present, many of the states are already heavily indebted even as experts have called for caution on the grounds that being election year, governors, especially those rounding off their tenures must not procure loans for political purposes only to leave the liability for those taking over from them. Umar Mohammed, a public expenditure expert, said 2023 is a defining moment and urged governors to do the right thing in terms of income generation and spending. “It is a tempting period, especially for those serving out their tenures. The budget will just be midway by the time they would hand over. Therefore, they should be mindful of the conceptualisation of their projects; they must not undertake while elephant projects. “Banks and other financial institutions must also be mindful of how they give loans to states because some of these people would divert the funds for campaigns,” he said.

State budgets are mere rituals – Expert Speaking on the findings of the analysis, a financial expert and CEO of Cowry Asset Management, Johnson Chukwu, said the challenge with state government budgets is that there is no science in it. “You have a state budget that is not adhered to but is a mere ritual. It is a difficult thing to use the state budget as a basis for projection for macroeconomic analysis. “A lot of states do not have fiscal discipline and do not follow through the budget process for anything. We had a state which makes budget of trillions but actual revenue is less than 10 per cent of what was budgeted and gives it high sounding names,” he said. He added that for states to make a determined approach to the budgeting process, there is the need for the federal government to introduce fiscal federalism. “Once that is introduced, state governments will be compelled to seek ways to generate revenue to sustain their operations. “As long as we continue with this sharing formula where a state government will not do anything to grow its revenue but be sure that at the end of every month, the governor will have enough which he does not know how it was generated, that for me, does not build responsibility on the path of building these sub-nationals,” he stated. He maintained that this has contributed to why Nigeria is underdeveloped, as there is no system that would develop by building on handouts “which is the fiscal system we have.” “The federating states in other jurisdictions actually contribute to the centre and live on their income. Unless they have difficult challenges when the centre will go in to support them. “But it is not a norm for you to wait for Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) meeting to collect money and use it however you like,” he said. He, therefore, said there is a need to change the extant law and push for fiscal federalism where state governments generate their revenue; spend from what they generate and contribute to the centre.
