The Court of Appeal has reserved judgment in the appeal by Governor Ademola Adeleke challenging the Osun State governorship election. A three-member panel headed by Justice Mohammed Lawal Shuaibu on Monday reserved the judgement after the arguments of Adeleke’s lawyers and a former governor’s, Gboyega Oyetola. Adeleke had on February 9, appealed the judgement of the Osun State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal which nullified his election. The tribunal ruled in favour of Oyetola by holding that he proved the allegation of over-voting in some of the polling units.
