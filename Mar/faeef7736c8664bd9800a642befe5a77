The national chairperson of the Women’s World Day Prayer (WWDP), Evangelist Dame Florence Uche has advocated for the gender inclusion of at least, 35 per cent of women in all the governance processes in the country. Specifically, she called on the incoming government not to segregate but to ensure that females get 35 percent and the youth 25 percent representation in government to eliminate gender discrimination and ensure equality for all men and women. Uche said this in an interview with journalists on the sidelines of the just-concluded WWDP Annual Programme held over the weekend at the National Christian Center (NCC), Abuja. She further called on the government to put an end to the untold hardship that is affecting the citizens of this country and put a stop to incessant killings going on in some parts of the country.
