Executive Director, National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), Faisal Shuaib, said the federal government would introduce Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in the country’s routine immunization schedule this year. The HPV vaccine helps to prevent cervical cancer, which is the second most common form of cancer diagnosed in women in Sub-Saharan Africa. Shuaib said the agency was galvanising the sub-national levels to make hepatitis B vaccine widely available in Nigeria to protect Nigerians against liver cancer. The Minister of Health, Osagie Ehanire, advised Nigerians to shun life style practices such as sedentary lifestyle that increases risk of cancer. He added that the country would also implement malaria vaccine this year.
