Traders at the Abuja Computer Complex in Wuse Zone 3 have complained that their shops were on Wednesday destroyed to pave way for a new building. One of the traders, Gbenga Udubayo, said that the developer who got approval from the FCTA for redesigning and developing the facility was the mastermind of the operation despite a court injunction against it. He explained that the developer carried out a similar operation in January, last year, to erect a fence. “But we rushed to an FCT High Court sitting at Maitama where we secured a temporary order stopping him from the operation. “They disobeyed the order and they were sanctioned by the court. The order was, however, lifted in December, last year, but again we rushed to an appeal court where we sought for another order to stop him, and the matter was still pending with a letter of summons issued to them. “So, we are surprised to see them coming again and to carry out this operation.’’ Udubayo, who is the chairman of the site’s allottees’ Board of Trustees, noted that their lawyer had swung into action. if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[336,280],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_0',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');Contacted, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Blizzard Nig Limited, Bashir Musa Hamza, said his firm was set to start the project of rebuilding the market following a court ruling that granted the approval.
