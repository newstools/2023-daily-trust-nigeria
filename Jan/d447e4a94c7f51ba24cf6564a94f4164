The Labour Party (LP) has dismissed reports that the party does not have polling agents in core northern states as it campaigns and prepares for this year’s elections. The LP Presidential Campaign Committee (LPPCC) spokesman, Dr Yunusa Tanko, said in Abuja Sunday that Nigerians should snub “Opposition’s orchestrated propaganda” that the LP does not have polling agents in core northern states. He said, “The attention of the LPPCC has been drawn to yet another deceitful information circulating in the social media to the effect that our party has not submitted agents for 90,000 polling units in North Central, North East and North West. “LP has foot soldiers scattered to man all polling units in the north and the entire nation. Opposition gimmicks to weaken the resolved minds of Nigerians to vote Peter Obi and Datti Baba-Ahmed into power this year will not fly. “We see this as yet another propaganda from the opposition to bring our rising influence down and deceive the electorate in an election year. We have volunteers all over the country that surpass even the number of agents required for each polling booth, so the issue of not being able to supply agents for 90,000 units is a complete fallacy designed by the enemies of progress in Nigeria,” Tanko said. He added that the LP has a task force on the recruitment and selection of agents headed by its presidential candidate, Peter Obi himself and his vice, Yusuf Datti, the national chairman while the national secretary of the party are all members of that committee.
