Battle-hardened former world number one Andy Murray staged a defiant new fightback Thursday to beat French qualifier Alexandre Muller to a place in the Qatar Open semi-finals and declared himself ready to win another title before he retires. On Friday, Murray will now take on Czech powerhitter Jiri Lehecka, 21, who also came back from a set down to overcome top seeded Russian, Andrey Rublev. Number two seed Felix Auger-Aliassime of Canada is now the tournament favourite after beating Spain’s Alejandro Davidovich-Fokina 6-4, 7-6 (7/5) in the day’s last match. Auger will have to beat third seed Danil Medvedev of Russia.
