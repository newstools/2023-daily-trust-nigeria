Lobi Stars Vice-Chairman, Doiminic Iorfa, has said the former Nigerian champions are intensifying preparations for the 2022/2023 Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) season. The former Nigerian international who spoke from the United Kingdom where he is on vacation said Lobi Stars have beefed up their squad with quality signings and would give opponents a run for their money. “To avoid a repeat of what happened last season before I was called upon to come and rescue the club, we have recruited some experienced players to strengthen the squad in key areas. “The technical crew too has been up and doing in ensuring that the players are in top shape, mentally and physically. So, I can say we are fully set for the new season,” said Iorfa.
