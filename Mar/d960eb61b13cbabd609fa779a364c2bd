The Federal Government has embarked on an infrastructural audit of the Nigerian Communications Satellite (NIGCOMSAT) Ltd for optimal performance and upward revenue generation. The board chairman of the agency, Arc. Yusuf Kazaure who disclosed this yesterday said the move is part of efforts to rejig the operations of the communications satellite agency for an increased revenue generation drive. Kazaure in a communique issued at the end of a two-day management retreat held in Abuja at the weekend added that the federal government had resolved to re-validate the company’s vision to properly align with the realities of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) demands. The chairman said FG is rejigging the agency’s operations to guard against volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity in Nigeria’s satellite industry to increase its revenue.
