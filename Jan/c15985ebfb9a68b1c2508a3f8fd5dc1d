A former Governor of Enugu State, Senator Chimaroke Nnamani and Governor of Kwara State, AbdulRahman AbdulRasaq have endorsed the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, ahead of the February 25 polls. Nnamani said he was backing Tinubu despite being a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Nnamani, a serving senator, has been suspended by his party over alleged anti-party activities. The lawmaker, in a statement yesterday, said with the emergence of Atiku Abubakar as PDP presidential flagbearer, the opposition party breached its own constitution and denied the South the opportunity to run for the presidency. The statement reads in part: “Having critically examined the situation, I found Ahmed Bola Tinubu as the preferred candidate from the South to foot the bill in 2023.” Similarly, Gov AbdulRasaq said he was passionate about Tinubu becoming the next President of Nigeria because of his belief in him to deliver the impactful projects he promised the state. Speaking in Lagos while interacting with Kwara professionals based in the Centre of Excellence, the governor said, “It is important we have a president we can sit with. I am passionate about him doing what he promised us. He will deliver highly impactful projects for us.”
