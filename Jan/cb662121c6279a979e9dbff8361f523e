The Nigerian National Agricultural Land Development Authority (NALDA) is assisting farmers in Azare Local Government Area of Bauchi State, North East Nigeria, with an earth dam, land clearing, and inputs to increase food production. The dam is projected to meet the water demands for irrigation and over 10,000 animals in three communities in the region, as NALDA will offer solar-powered pumping devices to pump water to farmland nearby. Tractors and site workers were already deployed to ensure the dam is completed within the stipulated time frame. During a meeting with farmers in Gamawa, NALDA Executive Secretary, Prince Paul Ikonne, stated that the project aims to ensure the availability of water for irrigation and animal husbandry in order to reduce farmer/herder disputes in the country. The representative of Gamawa District Head, Mohammed Babayo, who spoke on behalf of the farmers, thanked the government for the dam, urging NALDA to provide additional inputs such as improved seeds, fertilisers, pesticides, herbicides, and access roads to farmers in the area. Mohammed, who spoke in Hausa, stated that they were eager to donate more areas for clearing and are open to new collaborations with NALDA. The Districts head said agriculture activities in the area had always been a result of the farmers’ collaborative efforts. The NALDA CEO praised the farmers’ excitement and told them that NALDA will provide inputs as well as other needed assistance. Explaining the importance of the dam to the farmers, Ikonne said; “the water you see in the Dam now is not rainwater so what it means is that when rain falls, you will have enough water for all-year-round farming in partnership with NALDA.” With the 500 hectares donated by the communities, Ikonne said NALDA will provide additional earth dams and pumping machines to further boost irrigation farming in the second location.
