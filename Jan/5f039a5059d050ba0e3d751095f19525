The Nigerian Navy has won the Paintball Combat Competition, defeating the Nigerian Army during sporting events organised to commemorate the 2023 Armed Forces Remembrance Day Celebration (AFRDC). The paintball is a simulated combat situation to develop strategy, skills and teamwork minus the danger of live munitions fire. Speaking at the event in Abuja over the weekend, the Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Lucky Irabor commended the forest hunters for the idea and pledged to continue to partner with the organisation to make the paintball combat competition an annual event. He said the armed forces would do further modifications to the game to suit the Nigerian environment going forward. Irabor congratulated members of the armed forces particularly the veterans for the good work they had done to keep the nation united. “For us in the armed forces, we also thought as a prelude to the wreath-laying event, that there has to be a series of events that will indeed lead to the climax. “The paintballing festival is one of such innovations. Two days ago and yesterday, we had a golf tournament packaged to honour our veterans and I am glad to say that they were there in their numbers. if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[336,280],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_3',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');“The event that we have witnessed tonight is to further honour them and to let them know that their services were never forgotten,” he said.
