The Registrar of Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB), Professor Ishaq Oloyede, has disclosed that over 1.16 million tertiary institutions admission seekers have so far registered for the 2023 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME). Professor Oloyede stated this on Saturday while monitoring some CBT centres in Abuja. He said the Board would not extend deadline for the 2023 Unified UTME registration, while warning centers against extortion of candidates. The sale of 2023 UTME commenced on Saturday,14th January, 2023, and close on Tuesday, 14th February, 2023 UTME : JAMB cancels registrations of 817 candidates, asks them to register afresh 2023 UTME: JAMB Targets 1.8m Candidates, Registers 445,081 The JAMB Registrar said, “Registration is going on well except some of these schools. UTME is not a school based examination, it’s individual candidates and you can see what that school, Stella Maris is doing, collecting N30,000 from candidates in the name of JAMB and then end up missing up the telephone number of the candidates.” He said once they keep the telephone number of candidates, “it is unlikely that the candidates when we are contacting them if we want to make a change in their timetable, you send text to them and it will not get to them after they have graduated from the school and want to do change of course they don’t have access to it. “That is a way of extorting the parents and we will take adequate steps to make sure that we stop that. One of the reasons is that we will tell every CBT center to stop doing bulk purchase of pin and bulk registration so if a center sales more than one pin to a source or collect money for more than one pin from a source then we will sanction such center.” He urged candidates to report cases of extortion, saying that there is a code for candidates to reach the board when they come across any case of extortion, while promising there will be a reward for such act.
