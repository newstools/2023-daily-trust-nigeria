Dr Zainab Bagudu, wife of Governor Abubakar Bagudu of Kebbi State, has mobilised women from the state’s 21 LGAs to canvass votes for the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu and the governorship candidate of the party in the state, Dr Nasiru Idris. The governor’s wife, at a campaign rally in Argungu area of the state Sunday, said the APC deserved women’s support and votes in the forthcoming elections because it has done so much for them at the state and national levels. She said, “I enjoin you to come out in large numbers and vote APC government from top to bottom. Let APC continue with its good work. The APC government across the country has done well for women.” Dr Zainab said President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration has demonstrated its support for women across the country through various empowerment programmes.
