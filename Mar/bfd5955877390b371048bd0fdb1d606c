Ondo State Governor Rotimi Akeredolu has congratulated the president-elect, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, on his victory in last Saturday’s elections. The governor, however, asked  the candidates of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar and Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi and others who contested against Tinubu to accept defeat and support him in the interest of the nation. In a congratulatory message titled, ‘It is a New Dawn for Renewed Hope for the People’, yesterday, Akeredolu said Tinubu’s victory was well deserved. “I must hasten to join all the good people of this country to congratulate the winner of the keenly contested 2023 presidential election, the President-Elect Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, and the Vice President-elect Senator Kashim Shettima, on the well-deserved victory. Presidential poll: Imo, Rivers results were manipulated – Yiaga Africa I have reasons to sue INEC over election results – Ex-minister “I extend this courtesy to all Nigerians for making history and rendering nugatory the dark prophecies of workers of iniquity. They have exhibited uncommon resilience in the face of extreme provocation orchestrated by the enemies of this country to frustrate the whole process. “The president-elect himself has magnanimously extended an olive branch to all contestants. It is hoped that these patriots will avail the people of their services at different levels. This is the time that all hands must be on deck to surmount the challenges currently faced by the country. “There should be no difficulty for them to join hands with the in-coming government if the focus is indeed service to the people,” Akeredolu stated.
