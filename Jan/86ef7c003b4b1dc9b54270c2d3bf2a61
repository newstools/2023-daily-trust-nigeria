The Nasarawa State Government has tasked its club, Nasarawa United to win the 2022/23 abridged Nigeria Premier Football League (NPFL) or secure a continental ticket. This charge was given by the state’s Commissioner for Youth and Sports Development, Lucky Isaac Yargwa, during a meeting with the players and officials of the club. “We have been following all your pre-season activities. I must say everyone in the state as well as your supporters and fans across the length and breadth of the country are very proud of your progress reports. “This season’s league is somewhat strange to some of you the players because it’s not the straight kind of league you all know – it’s the abridged format where you play a fewer number of matches, and your Group is a tough one. “We know you are not only equal to the task but can outperform your previous records and play in the Super-Six which will determine the eventual league winners. “Winning the League or picking one of the Continental tickets should be our minimum benchmark this campaign,” he said. Yargwa further assured that the team would soon return to their traditional home ground, the Lafia City Stadium, as he said the contractor handling the renovation work had promised to complete it before the end of the first week of February, 2023. if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[300,250],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_3',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');Responding, Technical Adviser of Nasarawa United, Bala Nikyu, said the visit was a huge encouragement as it would strengthen them to improve on their performance beginning with their first tie this weekend against former African champions, Enyimba of Aba.
