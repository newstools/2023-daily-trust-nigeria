Gunmen, in the early hours of Sunday, stormed Paze, a community around the Byazhin area on the outskirts of Kubwa town in the FCT, and abducted four people. City & Crime reports that four heads of families were separately abducted from their homes, but their wives and other members were spared. Our reporter, who visited the community yesterday, saw people discussing the incident in groups. A housewife, Juliet Olarenwaju, whose husband was among those abducted, said she was on her way back home from church with her husband after attending the New Year’s crossover night, some minutes after 1am, when the incident happened. “As we were approaching home, we saw people numbering about 15 coming from the nearby bush, and walking toward us. “Then they started splitting themselves as we were getting closer; that was when my husband whispered to me that the people looked suspicious and that they were up to something. “So, he asked me to rush into our compound immediately and open the burglary attached to our bungalow, while he was closing the entrance door of the house. if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[250,250],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_3',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[250,250],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_4',151,'0','1'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0_1'); .box-4-multi-151{border:none !important;display:block !important;float:none !important;line-height:0px;margin-bottom:15px !important;margin-left:auto !important;margin-right:auto !important;margin-top:15px !important;max-width:100% !important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px;padding:0;text-align:center !important;}My husband had to rush to join me, and lock the burglary door, immediately. “They later broke the burglary and started doing the same on our second door, while at the same time demanding us to come out. “My husband asked them what they wanted and in the process, handed over all the available money with him along with our two mobile phones. “But they insisted that we should come out. They broke the second door and came in. “They beat my husband,’’ she added. Joy Daniel, another housewife in the area, also narrated how gunmen broke into their compound and dragged them out, collected their money, foodstuff and mobile phones. She said her husband, Daniel Audu, along with two other heads of families in the neighbourhood, namely Solomon Ayongo and another identified as Jerry, were abducted. Madam Joy, who is heavily pregnant, said she was beaten mercilessly by the attackers. She said the attackers forced them to sit on the ground and left with four people. A community leader in the area, Mr Julius Igbaho, said on getting a phone call about the incident, he passed the information on to the commander of the vigilantes in Byazhin area of the community.
