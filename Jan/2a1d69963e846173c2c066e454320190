The Kaduna State governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Uba Sani, has promised to involve traditional rulers in the fight against insecurity in the state if elected. The senator, who made the pledge in Kagarko yesterday during his campaign rally, said traditional rulers were closer to the people and can gather intelligence and share with security agents. He further said his administration would continue to respect the traditional institutions, and promised to focus on skill acquisition for youths. He added that his administration would construct the Jere-Kagarko road in the state.
