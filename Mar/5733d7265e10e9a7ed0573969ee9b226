Kwara State Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq has reiterated his “commitment to gender mainstreaming in the state.” The governor said this on Tuesday in a statement to commemorate International Women’s Day (IWD). The event is celebrated globally every March 8. He said Kwara under him would remain a record holder and positive reference point in gender inclusion in public service. He said women were half of the human community and should have a befitting place at the table where decisions affecting them and their families are made. “Whether as mothers, wives or girl-children, women are unique in their being great teachers, pillars of support, balancers and critical team players in every family and organisation. “No society can achieve sustainable growth without giving women their pride of place. This is why Kwara has created a niche for itself as the prime promoter of gender parity in governance,” the governor said.
