Watermelon farmers are excited as they are set to make brisk business during this year’s harvest season in Jigawa State. Every year during the harmattan period watermelon farmers in the state harvest and sell their products to different parts of the country and beyond. They export the product to as far as the neighbouring Niger Republic and other close African countries. Muhammad Afno Takazza from Takazza community in Guri LGA said, “I sold my watermelon and realised good profits this period. I sold the watermelon for N40,000 per 100 pieces.” He added that, “I have spent many years doing the watermelon business. I married two wives and have 10 children. I have married off two of my daughters; all with the business. “I usually take the watermelon to the South East, South West and North East, but the challenges we are facing now are connected with the increase of fuel price and other transport issues. Other farmers in the community said that immediately after they experienced serious flooding they decided to increase their dry season farming. Ibrahim Takazza, another farmer, said, “The watermelon market this season is very good. Alhaji Ibrahim Mai Kolawa on his part said, “After I sold my watermelon I got more than triple of what I spent.” In Karnaya community of Dutse LGA, most of the farmers said watermelon this year had good yield and that the price was so good, unlike last year when they sold it for very low prices. Daily Trust on Sunday reports that watermelon is grown in tropical to temperate regions worldwide. It is around 90 per cent water, which makes it useful for staying hydrated in the dry season. It can also satisfy a sweet tooth with its natural sugars and contains antioxidants. These substances help remove some molecules known as free radicals or reactive species from the body.
