The Federal Government, through National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), has said it will create five million jobs through small agriculture. The government has also distributed smart agriculture materials to beneficiaries of the National Adopted Village for Smart Agriculture (NAVSA) in Katsina. This was disclosed during the closing ceremony of the five-day empowerment programme held Al-Qalam University, Katsina, Katsina State, yesterday. The government has also improved green energy-powered smart brooding to enhance the survival rate of broilers, a smart irrigation system to support a year-long production, and a soil nutrient monitoring system to support information-driven farming on a demo land. Director-General, NITDA, Kashifu Inuwa, represented by Acting Director, Digital Economy Development of the agency, Salisu Kaka, said: “Agriculture remains one of the critical sectors of Nigeria’s economy. This is evident in the policies of the current administration led by President Muhammadu Buhari.  Every economic, developmental and social policy gives agriculture priority.” Inuwa said the NAVSA Empowerment would enhance agriculture value chain, create new value and opportunities through new business models and services.
