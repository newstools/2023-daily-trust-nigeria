Sterling Bank, has decided to waive all personal account transaction fees to encourage its customers to engage their channels Abubakar Suleiman, the bank’s CEO, made the announcement in an email to customers yesterday. The message in the mail to Sterling’s clients read, “We at Sterling recognise the difficult circumstances many of our customers are going through. In light of this, from February 6, 2023, through February 18, 2023, our fund transfer services will be provided free of charge to all personal account customers. “In addition, we are glad to inform you that we will provide free Debit Cards to all interested customers. This will provide you with a convenient and secure way to make purchases and carry out transactions.” This is viewed as part of Sterling Bank’s continued efforts to support her customers and the general public as Nigeria adjusts to the availability of the new Naira notes that are now being distributed across the country.
