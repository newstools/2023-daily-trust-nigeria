A group within the All Progressives Congress (APC), Progressive Young Women’s Forum (PYWF), has trained 5,000 women from the 44 LGAs and 484 wards of Kano State on election planning and monitoring. Speaking at the one-day workshop held at the Sani Abacha Indoor Stadium, the convener and representative of the forum, Balarabe Aliyu Madugu, said the gathering was part of the APC’s efforts in ensuring that women fully participated in the electoral process. Madugu said, “Today is one of the historic moments in my life, and you all that support me, encourage me and believe in me to champion the course of democracy towards the development of our dear state in particular and the country at large. “As you are all aware, we are here to educate, enlighten and sensitise ourselves on election planning, monitoring and to honour some distinguished politicians of our time who have been very supportive at all times in moving our great party, which is the ruling APC, forward.”
