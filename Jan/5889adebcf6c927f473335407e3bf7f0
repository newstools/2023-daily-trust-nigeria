A group of women in Jos, Plateau State, have distributed items including sweaters, slippers, soap and detergent to almajiri students to cushion the effect of this year’s weather condition in Jos. The women said they distributed the items due to the cold weather condition of the state, especially during the harmattan season, adding that they were worried about the condition of the almajiri children during this period and decided to distribute the items to give them a sense of belonging. Hajiya Ladi Mu’azu, Secretary of Motherhen Initiative, while distributing the items, said the group realized what the almajiri students were passing through, saying “we were born and raised in Jos, and therefore ought to pay back to the society. Hajiya Larai Binta Hassan, coordinator of the group, while commenting on the gesture, said they looked not only at the almajiri but other vulnerable children. “We understand that during this period, almajiri students and other vulnerable children face lots of challenges, and so, we saw the need to tackle the situation,” she said. They advised the children to avoid roaming the streets and bad friends who would distract them from the essence of their enrollment in the various tsangaya schools, which is to learn and memorise the Glorious Qur’an.
