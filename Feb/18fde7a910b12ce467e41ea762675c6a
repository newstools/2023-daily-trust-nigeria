The Lead Pastor of the Good Tidings Bible Church International, Dayo Olutayo, has urged candidates and the nation’s registered political parties to accept the outcome of the February 25 and March 11 general elections. He gave the charge on Sunday in Abuja at the church’s ‘International Day of Prayers’ to ensure the success of the coming elections and also celebrate the nation’s teachers. The event saw candidates and representatives of the parties, INEC representatives and other stakeholders committing themselves to the success of the elections. According to him, the country’s forthcoming elections will be the turning point for the nation and the success and choice of leaders will promote peace, unity and development of the country. He said that the prayer was to implore God’s help in preventing violence, manipulation, intimidation of voters and other electoral crimes in the forthcoming elections.
