Nigeria has about 25 percent of all Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) in Africa, with millions of persons at risk. The Minister of Health, Osagie Ehanire, said this yesterday in Abuja during the commemoration of the World Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) Day,  organised  by the ministry in collaboration with the World Health Organisation (WHO). NTDs include lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis, soil transmitted helminthes, buruli ulcers, leishmaniasis, dengue, guinea worm disease, trachoma, leprosy, rabies, noma, yaws, mycetoma and snakebites. He said 122 million people were at risk of lymphatic filariasis, 33 million at risk of onchocerciasis, 20.8 million at risk of  schistosomiasis, 29.4 million at risk of soil transmitted helminths, 5.3 million at risk of  trachoma- and 6.5 million at risk of Human African Trypanosomiasis- respectively.

Meanwhile, the WHO yesterday released a new progress report, entitled ‘Global Report on Neglected Tropical Diseases 2023’ which showed that the number of people requiring NTD interventions fell by 80 million between 2020 and 2021, with eight countries were certified or validated as having eliminated one NTD in 2022 alone. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, said around the world, millions of people had been liberated from the burden of neglected tropical diseases “which keep people trapped in cycles of poverty and stigma.”
