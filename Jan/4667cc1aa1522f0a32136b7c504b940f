Senator Bello Mandiya (APC, Katsina South) has distributed 138 tricycles, 200 motorcycles and other empowerment items to his constituents. Daily Trust reports that Mandiya, who was elected in 2019, has failed to secure the ticket of the APC for a second term. Other items disbursed were 750 water pumps, 202 deep freezers, 350 grinding machines and 3,500 bags of fertiliser. Presenting the items in Kafur, Mandiya, asked his supporters to vote for APC at all levels. “APC is my party, it made me what I am today by the grace of God. I am therefore calling on all my supporters to vote for the party from top to bottom in the forthcoming general elections,” he said. In his remarks, Governor Aminu Bello Masari lauded the courage of the senator for accepting fate and giving back to the constituency. He called on other politicians to emulate the gesture, saying it was a critical time when the party needed support from all those who benefitted from it as it faces general elections.
