A Sharia Court in Magajin-Gari, Kaduna, on Tuesday, dissolved the marriage between Muhammad Abdulganiyu and Ma’arufat Ibrahim. Abdulganiyu, in his petition, alleged that his wife left their matrimonial home without any altercation. “I tried my best to provide for her, but she and her mother do not appreciate my efforts, and we’ve been married barely three months. “If she’s not interested in the marriage anymore, she should pay me all I spent during the wedding and return the phone and silver rings I gave her,” he said. But the wife told the court that she left because her husband did not provide food for her. The judge, Malam Rilwan Kyaudai, said the marriage was dissolved after all efforts to reconcile the couple by the court and their guardians failed. He ordered the woman to return N20,000 paid as dowry. if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[336,280],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_2',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');“She will also return the marriage suitcases she received and their contents, with the exception of the ones she has sown. “She will not return the cell phone as requested by the complainant, but she will return the silver rings she received from him,” the judge ruled.
