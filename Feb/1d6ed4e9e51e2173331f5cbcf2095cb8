Supporters of Labour Party (LP) in Damaturu, Yobe state were yesterday disappointed over the failure of the partyâ€™s presidential candidate, Peter Obi to show up at a campaign rally. Obi and his running mate Dr Datti Baba Ahmed were billed to visit the state for presidential campaign which was scheduled to hold at Summit Conference Hotel in Damaturu by 11:00 am.

Addressing the supporters, Hajiya Hauwa Bukar, the North East Coordinator, Obi-Datti Presidential Campaign Council pleaded with them, saying the postponement of campaign was not meant to disappointed them.
