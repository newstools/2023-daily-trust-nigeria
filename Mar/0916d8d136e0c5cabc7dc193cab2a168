The Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) has completed the perimeter fencing of the Tin-Can Island port, Lagos to prevent cargo theft. The Managing Director of NPA, Mohammed Bello-Koko, who was on a tour of the port to ascertain the level of the project execution, said it would also ensure that only people that should be in the port had access to it, NPA said in a statement. “We can see that Tin-Can port has now been fenced using concrete walls from the outside. The essence is to secure the port, not just because of safety, but also to restrict entrance. “There are individuals that just wake up in the morning and want to come into the port, with no business in the port. By reducing the number of persons and by restricting entry into the port, you are ensuring that we reduce pilfering and theft, reduce thugs and miscreants from the port.  “Then it will create an enabling business environment within the port location as preferred by the International Ship and Port Facility (ISPS) Code,” he said. On other security measures, he said NPA had bought security patrol boats for the waterside and was working with the Nigerian Navy within the ports in Lagos to increase patrol.
