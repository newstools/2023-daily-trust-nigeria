The Kebbi State Hunters and Forest Security Service on Wednesday directed its personnel to stay away from polling units during the elections on Saturday. The Commander of the service, Ambassador Musa Hussaini Rambo, explained that the directive was in line with the Commissioner of Police (CP) and Directorate of Security Services’ (DSS’) directive that only the police, army, customs, immigration, civil defence and correctional service were allowed to participate in the security arrangement for the general elections. He said he was calling on his personnel to abide by the directive because they were law-abiding citizens with a high level of commitment to the security situation in the country. Ambassador Rambo further said he had directed his personnel to go to the pollíng units to exercise their franchise as citizens of Nigeria.
