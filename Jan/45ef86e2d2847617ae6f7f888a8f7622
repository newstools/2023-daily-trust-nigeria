The Medical Laboratory Science Council of Nigeria (MLSCN) has warned graduating students to desist from seeking their NYSC deployment without completing their internship. The registrar of the council, Dr Tosan Erhabor, gave the warning during the induction ceremony for 10 pioneer medical laboratory scientists who graduated from Al-Hikmah University, Ilorin. “Let me warn you against seeking the NYSC deployment without first completing your internship programme or having a full scholarship license. “Some of your predecessors who ignored this warning and proceeded to camp ended up embarrassing themselves. “From the mistake of the foolish, the wise learn their lessons. So learn accordingly,” he cautioned. While congratulating the university for graduating its first set of students, Dr Erhabor said the strides made would boost the profile of the programme. Represented by Prof. Olayanju Dickson, he advocated for the training of more personnel in the health sector to meet the needs of the nation. if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[336,280],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_3',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');In his address, the vice-chancellor of the institution, Prof. Noah Yusuf, said the induction ceremony was an important event and contribution to the country’s medical sector.
