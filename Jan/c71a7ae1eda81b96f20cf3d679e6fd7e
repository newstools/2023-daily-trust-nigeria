Dr Babayo Liman, the North-East Zonal Secretary of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) and a member of the Rabiu Kwankwaso presidential campaign council have defected to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Dr Liman announced his defection from NNPP alongside hundreds of supporters of the Kwankwasiyya Movement in Gombe State and declared their support for Atiku Abubakar, the PDP presidential candidate. Briefing reporters in Gombe, Dr Liman said he resigned from NNPP and joined PDP to support its presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar. “We registered more than 3.6 million people in the North East region under NNPP and Gombe is one of the states in my zone, hence the need for me to go round and inform my supporters that I have defected to PDP. “I have resigned my appointment as the Northeast zonal secretary of the NNPP and as a member of the presidential campaign council of the NNPP, as well as the coordinator of the Kwankwasiyya movement in the zone,” Liman said.
