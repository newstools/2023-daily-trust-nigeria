The Special Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on Digital Communication, Malam Bashir Ahmad has dared Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje of Kano state to take his old naira notes to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) if they are legitimate. Ahmad was replying to Ganduje who faulted the naira redesign policy and described it as a move to scuttle democracy and sabotage the forthcoming general elections. Ganduje also accused Buhari of introducing the policy at the eve of elections, saying it should have been done in the past seven years or after the election. However, in a reply to Ganduje and others, Ahmad said they should stop making noise and take their old naira notes to the CBN. He said, “Many people thought that the people talking about the policy is for the right of the masses, not knowing that they are doing it for themselves. They stocked huge amount of money and they are afraid of taking it to the CBN because EFCC and NFIU (Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit) are watching them. He, however, replied Ganduje though jokingly, saying, “Baba Dan Audu, President Baba Buhari has ordered that you should take your money to CBN. If EFCC and NFIU certified that they are legitimate, you will receive alert.” On Ganduje’s allegations that Buhari has scuttled the democracy, Bashir Ahmad said, “I didn’t know that the democracy has decayed until when I contested for elections in Kano, and during the primaries, they rigged the election on the ground that I am a politician from Abuja.”
