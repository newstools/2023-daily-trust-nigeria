Nasarawa State Governor, Abdullahi Sule, has decried the calls for the resignation of the National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Abdullahi Adamu. The National Vice Chairman (North West) of the APC, Mallam Salihu Lukman, and some civil society groups have asked Adamu to quit his position, saying his resignation would ensure power balancing in the incoming Bola Tinubu-led government in view of the party’s Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket. But Gov Sule described the calls as untimely, rude and completely unnecessary, saying the calls amounted to sheer wickedness and disrespect for all the efforts of Adamu before, during and after the elections. He stated this yesterday during a meeting with former aspirants of the APC from across the state at the Government House, Lafia. Reps’ Speakership: APC should reward Wase for competence, loyalty Ex-gov’ship aspirant, others dump PDP in Ondo He said, “At a time when we are having these successes, we saw in the news media that some people are calling for the resignation of the national chairman. We condemn that call, especially at a time like this. “The gentleman who has worked so hard, even at his age, going around everywhere with our presidential candidate for the campaigns, meetings and several initiatives taken to tackle various issues, for someone to call for his resignation in the middle of elections; that is uncalled for, unfair; that is wickedness, rude and completely unnecessary.
