A Federal High Court sitting in Abuja has dismissed a suit filed by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) seeking an order disqualifying Kwara State governor, Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq, from participating in the March governorship election in the state. Justice Inyang Ekwo dismissed the suit for being incompetent and an abuse of court process. He said PDP lacked the right to sue since it wasn’t a participant in the APC governorship primaries that produced the governor. The judge said Section 29(5) of the Electoral Act 2022 provides that only an aspirant who participated in a party’s primary poll can seek to disqualify another. The suit, which was filed on Aug. 4, 2022, had urged the court to make an order directing the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to delist the name of Abdulrazaq as a candidate of the APC for the 2023 Kwara governorship election. Counsel to the PDP in the case, Paul Usoro (SAN), told our correspondent via phone that they were still studying the judgement.
