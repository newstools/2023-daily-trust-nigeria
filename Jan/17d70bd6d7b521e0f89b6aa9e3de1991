 By Sunday Michael Ogwu, Abdullateef Salau, Balarabe Alkassim (Abuja) & Salim Umar Ibrahim (Kano)  The National Assembly yesterday renewed its call on the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to extend the deadline for the withdrawal of the old notes from circulation from the current January 31st. The Senate at its seating yesterday asked the CBN to immediately extend the deadline for the withdrawal of old naira notes from circulation to July 31, 2023. Senators, during a debate on a motion by Sadiq Suleiman Umar (APC, Kwara) at Tuesday’s plenary, said the new notes were not enough in circulation,  warning that if the deadline was not extended, there would be chaos in many parts of the country. The Red Chamber also urged the CBN to compel deposit money banks to open a naira exchange window for those without bank accounts. Senate President Ahmad Lawan, assured that the National  Assembly leadership would ensure that the resolution is implemented by the CBN. Similarly, the House of Representatives has called on the CBN to review its policies on the newly redesigned currency and withdrawal limit. The call followed the adoption of a motion of urgent public importance moved by Sada Soli Jibia at the plenary on Tuesday. Presenting the motion, the lawmaker said, the CBN should bring its policies closer to realities than assumptions. He said, “In global best practices, currencies are phased out, not forced out. Thus, adequate time is required for this policy to be successful. “Due to inadequate sensitization and the rush in the implementation of the policy, the country is exposed to a situation whereby businesses are rejecting the old currency even in the face of unavailability of the redesigned new Naira notes.

He said: “We have pleaded with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission (ICPC) not to harass anybody, and on my honor, they will not do that.
