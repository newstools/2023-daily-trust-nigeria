The Corps Marshal of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Dauda Biu, has urged the motoring public to properly observe traffic regulations. This, he said, would help to reduce recklessness and road accidents generally. During a recent visit to several parts of Abuja, Biu re-iterated the commission’s determination to ensure the safety of lives of motorists and commuters. He advised owners of vehicles to always ensure that their vehicles were road-worthy at all times and to properly comply with traffic regulations whenever they were on the road. He said, “The commission is also doing its best to reduce road accidents on our roads all over the country, especially in cities and the nation’s capital city through rigorous and sustained public enlightenment drive and education of motor drivers all over the country. The intensification of the public enlightenment programme by the commission is a deliberate policy to enhance road safety among drivers. “We have also intensified lecturing of road traffic offenders all over the place aimed at inculcating improved road traffic observance by all categories of drivers.”
