The governorship candidate of the Labour Party (LP) in Kebbi State, Gambo Paul Tase, has denied claims that he has withdrawn from the race and defected to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). This followed claims on social media that Tase had pitched tent with the PDP and jettisoned his governorship ambition. In a statement yesterday in Abuja, Tase described the claims as fake news and handiwork of mischief makers and urged his supporters and LP members to come out en masse and vote for him and other LP candidates in Saturday’s polls. He promised to turn around the fortunes of the state for the good of the people by delivering good governance and providing new hope for future generations.
