The Senate Chief Whip, Orji Kalu, has said that the new naira policy by the Central Bank of Nigeria would not have any impact on the chances of the Presidential Candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu in the February 25 election. The former governor of Abia State stated this during an interview on Channels TV’s Politics Today. He said Tinubu is the next president and Commander-in-Chief of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. When asked if the new naira policy would have impact on Tinubu’s chances, Kalu said, “No, Tinubu is Tinubu and whoever made the policy is what he is. “The Supreme Court has already ruled and for us, the national chairman of the party who was also my colleague as governor we are on the same page. “If I was in the position of the President, I would obey the position of the Supreme Court. We are larger in number and biggest in atmosphere. We will win the election. “Tinubu is the next president and Commander-in-Chief of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. What gives me the confidence is that we have huge followers and huge support from Nigeria people.”
