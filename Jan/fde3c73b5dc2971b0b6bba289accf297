The Director General of the Industrial Training Fund, Sir Joseph Ari says as part of efforts to boost skills acquisition, the Fund in 2023 will introduce 35 trade areas that are interventionist in nature. He said the trade areas will include plumbing and fabrication, pipe fitting, oil and gas, and POP among others. Ari stated this in Abuja over the weekend while hosting the management team from LEADERSHIP Group Limited who presented him with the LEADERSHIP Public-Service Person of the Year 2022 award. He stressed the need for the country to embrace skills acquisition to enhance development, create jobs and attract foreign direct investments. According to Ari “About 60% of our population consists of the youth and so if we have a skilled population, we can even export skills out as it now the currency of the 21st century For instance, take National Industrial Skills Development Programme, then select 300 persons to be trained per state multiplied by 37 states including the FCT, we will have about 11,100 to be trained in one trade area. So it would be multiplied by 35 intervention programmes.” he said. He added that in 6 years, ITF has trained over 500,000 Nigerians with the requisite skills to key into the federal government’s job and wealth creation policy direction under the National Development Plan, NDP. if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[300,250],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_3',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');The vice chairman, of LEADERSHIP Group Limited, Mr Mike Okpere explained that the LEADERSHIP 2022 Award, was to recognise persons who attained positions of responsibility and are doing remarkable things in public service.
