 Property worth millions of naira were destroyed in Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State, on Saturday after the presidential and National Assembly polls. The rainfall destroyed churches, residential buildings, business premises, electrical poles and farms in areas like Dallimon, Okesa, old governorâ€™s office area, IIawe Road and Orire Owu. Speaking on the development, a trader, Mrs Yetunde Alimi, said she was not happy seeing her shop destroyed, noting that she needed a huge cash to put her shop back in order; hoping that help would come. Jide Borode, the General Manager of SEMA in Ekiti, said his men were moving around to get first-hand information and hand over such information to the government to take action. Borode stated that the agency would start to distribute relief materials to persons whose property were destroyed. On the electricity poles and wires broken or damaged, Borode said he had called the BEDC to take necessary action.
