 The federal government would spend N869 billion to conduct the forthcoming 2023 census, said the Minister of State for Finance, Budget and National Planning, Clem Agba. He stated this yesterday at an engagement for the 2023 Population and Housing in Abuja where Nigeria sought support from the private sector and international donors for the census. The minister said N626bn ($1.36bn) would be spent on pre and during the census exercise while N243bn ($527m) would be spent on post census. He said the government has so far spent N291.5bn ($632m) on the census, making it 46 per cent of the expected total funding. He stated that N327.2bn is required to complete the census, especially for the usage of digital gadgets with the transmission of census in real time. “The UNFPA has been and is currently providing significant technical and financial support to the census programme. We will be establishing a basket fund that will be managed by UNFPA. They are developing a link that will be made available for donors,” he said. The Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, said the census would be a green census involving the use of digital maps, digital questionnaires and cloud computing to ensure compliance with the global climate change campaign for reduction of emission by 30%. The United Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria, Mathias Schmale, stated that achieving a credible census in Nigeria would serve as a foundation for sustainable development. Chairman of the National Population Commission (NPC), Nasir Kwarra, assured donors that the funds would be used judiciously.
