The Nigeria Customs Service says it has built the capacity of its officers who are poised to generate more revenue for the federal government. Comptroller General of Customs, retired Col.  Hameed Ali, stated this on Tuesday in Abuja during the decoration of the newly promoted officers numbering 1,490. Three senior officers were promoted to the rank of Assistant Comptroller General of Customs (ACGs) while 1,490 officers were promoted to different ranks. Speaking on the target of the service Ali said, “The service has built the capacity of its officers to fulfil its mandate of revenue generation in the New Year.” He charged the newly promoted officers to be more responsible in their duties following their promotions as it is a call to serve over 200 million Nigerians. He added that all officers promoted merited their new ranks as the management of the service rewards hard work and dedication to service without fear or favour.
