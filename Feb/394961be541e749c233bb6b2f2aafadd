The Head of Civil Service of the Federation (HoCSF), Dr. Folasade Yemi-Esan, has urged the management and staff of the Office of the Head of Civil Service of the Federation (OHoCSF) to ensure continuous improvement in Quality Management System (QMS) in their delivery of services. She made the call yesterday in Abuja at the official presentation of an ISO 9001:2015 QMS certificate by the Managing Director, Digital Jewels Africa, Mrs. Adedoyin Odunfa. This connotes that the OHoCSF has fulfilled all requirements of the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO), necessitating the award by the International Independent Certification Authority (MSECB), Canada. In her acceptance speech, Dr. Yemi-Esan, said that compliance with the ISO 9001:2015 means that standards are maintained throughout the three-year certification cycle. “Since certification is not an end in itself, but the means to achieve continuous service quality improvement,” she said. Also, the Director, ICT in the OHCSF, Mr Dada Adeniyi was certified as QMS Manager, while five other staff were certified as Team Leads for the five Offices of the Permanent Secretaries in the OHCSF and two other Officers as Team Leads. The Managing Director/CEO, Digital Jewels Africa, Mrs. Adedoyin Odunfa, said given the centrality of the OHSCF to the Civil Service, the ability to streamline and simplify its processes to systematically imbibe a quality philosophy that delivers high quality services to its stakeholders, is a game changer for the entire Service and the nation, as a whole.
