The governorship candidate of the Labour Party (LP) in Kaduna State, Jonathan Asake, has assured the Muslim ummah that his administration would operate on the principles of fairness, equity and justice as enshrined in the 1999 constitution. Asake gave the assurance at the weekend when he and his running mate, Bashir Aliyu Idris, met with Muslim clerics in continuation of their dialogue with stakeholders in the state. He further said that as religious leaders who controlled large followers, the majority of whom had been affected by the wrong policies of the APC government, it was imperative to seek their prayers, support and interact on the way forward for the state. A statement by James Swam, spokesman to the governorship candidate, quoted Asake as urging the clerics to deeply reflect on the prevailing economic and security situations of the state. The statement reads in part: “I will be fair and just to all citizens and segments of the state. I will rule by the principle of justice as enshrined in the 1999 constitution (as amended). I will defend all and promote all, and each person will exercise their freedom as the constitution permits.”
