Following their triumphs in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, the Beach Soccer AFCON and the African Nations Championships in Algeria, Senegal have now added the U-20 AFCON title to their glittering trophy collection. The Teranga Cubs of Senegal defeated the Young Scorpions of Gambia 2-0 at the Cairo International Stadium Saturday. Goals from Soulayemane Faye and Mamadou Camara in either half were enough to give the Cubs their first-ever title on four attempts. They now become the first African country to simultaneously hold the continent’s most prestigious prizes. It will be noted that Senegal have played in three consecutive finals at the U20 AFCON in 2015, 2017 and 2019 without ever managing to win the coveted trophy until yesterday. The Teranga Cubs secured their fourth final place in the last five editions as they easily dispatched Tunisia 3-0 in the first semi-final on Monday at Ismailia to coast through. Prior to this game, the Senegal and Gambia were the only teams to have scored in every match without conceding but Senegal finished the tournament without conceding a goal from the group stage till the finals. It will be recalled that Nigeria beat Tunisia 3-0 for a podium finish in the third place on Friday at the Cairo International Stadium. The four nations will represent Africa at this year’s FIFA U-20 World Cup in Indonesia from May 20 to June 11, 2023. Meanwhile, Souleymane Faye was the Man of the Match with his teammate, Lamine Camara emerging as the Man of the Competition. Pape Dip emerged as the Umbro Golden Boot winner while Landing Badji won the best goalkeeper just as Nigeria claimed the fair play award.
