Arsenal head coach Mikel Arteta says there is ‘huge anger’ among his players ahead of Wednesday’s vital clash with Manchester City after a VAR mistake cost his side two points in the title race at the weekend. Lee Mason, the VAR official for the game, has since been stood down for his mistake in which he failed to draw the lines usually used to judge offside decisions. While Arteta is pleased that the club have received an apology, he said only having two more points added to their total would compensate for the error.
