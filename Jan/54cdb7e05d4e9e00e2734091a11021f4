Ogun Government has begun renovation of the MKO Abiola International Stadium, Abeokuta, to provide adequate comfort for spectators. The Chief Press Secretary to Gov. Dapo Abiodun, Mr Kunle Somorin, said in a statement that the 10,000-capacity stadium would be fully covered to ensure a facelift. He said that the renovation was part of Abiodun’s promise to raise the bar of sports and sporting activities in Ogun. According to him, it is a follow-up to the money spent on the state’s contingent to the just-concluded 2022 National Sports Festival hosted by Delta. He said that the reconstruction of the stadium started on Friday and had continued to Saturday morning as more materials and workers arrived the site. The governor’s aide said that the facelift was expected to be completed in four weeks. He noted that the stadium, named after the acclaimed winner of Nigeria’s June 12 Presidential Election, Bashorun MKO Abiola, who also hailed from Abeokuta, had been used as a multi-sports event centre for over two decades. if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[468,60],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_3',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');He said that the arrangement to cover the whole spectators stand would no doubt add beauty, comfort and further raise the standard of the facility.
