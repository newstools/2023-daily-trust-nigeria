 Nine candidates for the March 11, governorship election in Kaduna State have endorsed the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Muhammad Isah Ashiru. The governorship candidates that endorsed Ashiru are those of the Young Progressives Party (YPP), Action Alliance (AA), Allied Peoples Movement (APM), Action Peoples Party (APP), All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), National Rescue Movement (NRM), Zenith Labour Party (ZLP), Accord Party (AP) and Action Democratic Party (ADP). The nine candidates, who came under the auspices of the Rescue and Rebuild Gubernatorial Candidates Forum, said their support for Ashiru was total in order to rescue the state from socio-economic hardship. Addressing supporters of PDP, the Chairman of the forum, Sanin Yaya, said they took the decision after extensive consultation with their party members. He, therefore, urged voters in the state to shun the APC candidate and vote for Ashiru for a better Kaduna.
