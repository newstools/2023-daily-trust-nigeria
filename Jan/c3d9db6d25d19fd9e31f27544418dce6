The Sokoto State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has accused Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal of playing politics with the lives of his people. Addressing a press conference in Sokoto, the state capital yesterday, the state chairman of the APC, Isa Sadiq Achida, alleged that the PDP-led government was comfortable with the security situation and wants to use it as a campaign tool. Recall that while reacting to the attack on his convoy recently, Governor Tambuwal accused APC leaders of not doing anything to help in tackling the security challenges in the state. But the APC chairman said, “Aminu Waziri has been shifting the blame on the federal government, while in other states, governors have taken leading roles in curbing banditry.
