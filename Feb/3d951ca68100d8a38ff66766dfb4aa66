The Oyo state governor, Seyi Makinde has hinted that his government “is set to acquire the Obafemi Awolowo Sports Complex, formerly Liberty Stadium, from the Federal Government. “I am submitting a letter to the Minister for Youths and Sports to give Oyo State the Obafemi Awolowo Stadium. They have given the Nnamdi Azikwe Stadium in Enugu to Enugu State. “Last week, they gave the one in Kaduna to Kaduna State. So, it is on that basis that we are also saying they should give us this one, and I believe it will be successful.” He said his administration would continue to invest in sport facilities across the geopolitical zones of the state. According to him, the investment in sports facilities will help in the hunt and development of talents across the length and breadth of the state. “Let me also put it on record that we bided for the hosting of the next festival, but unfortunately, we lost to Ogun State. “But don’t worry, as that may give us time to even get a bit more grounded and also work on more of our facilities. After Ogun State, we will still bid,” he said. Makinde said that his administration would address the challenge of shortage of staff, completion of the remodelling of Lekan Salami Sports Complex, as requested by the State Sports Council. “Please, be rest assured that Lekan Salami Stadium will be completed on or before the end of this year. “The modern equipment you have requested will be procured to aid the performances of our athletes,” he said.
