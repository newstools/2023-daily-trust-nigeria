After the 15-point deduction that plunged them from third to 10th place, Juventus have recalibrated their Serie A goal to snatching a European slot, and the possible return of Paul Pogba and Dusan Vlahovic against Monza on Sunday should help. Juventus were on 37 points when the deduction for false accounting sent them sliding down to mid-table, leaving Italy’s most successful club with practically no chance of catching runaway leaders Napoli. Yet missing out on next season’s European competitions could see Juve suffer an even bigger blow. With 19 games left to play, they are still a hefty 14 points adrift of AS Roma, Inter Milan and Lazio, currently fifth, fourth and third respectively on 37 points, and 15 points behind second-placed AC Milan, who are all battling for a top-four finish and a spot in the Champions League. Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri praised his team’s attitude after they put aside their off-field troubles to rescue a 3-3 draw with Atalanta on Sunday, two days after the court ruling. With Vlahovic and Pogba readying to return to action there could be two big comebacks in the Bianconeri camp for the clash against the 13th-placed Monza, who are only one point behind Juventus. Both players, who are returning from lengthy injury absences, were expected to take part in a friendly against Juventus’ reserve team on Thursday, Italian media reported, and they could be called up by Allegri to face Monza. if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[300,250],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_3',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');The Frenchman has yet to play a game this season while Vlahovic, who participated in the 2022 World Cup with Serbia, has not played for Juventus since their Champions League clash against Benfica in October.
