A 48-year-old civil servant, Bala Musa, on Monday, dragged a Kannywood actress, Hadiza Gabon, before a Shari’a court in Kaduna for refusing to marry him. The complainant told the court that he had been in a relationship with the actress and that she promised to marry him. Musa told the court, “So far I have spent N396,000 on her. Anytime she asks for money, I give her without hesitation with the hope that we will marry. “She failed to show up in Gusau, Zamfara State, where I live after I made all arrangements to host her.” The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the case was first heard on May 23, but Hadiza was not in court. Hadiza’s counsel, Mubarak Kabir, explained that his client was not sure of the authenticity of the summons. He told the court that, “My client’s position as a celebrity attracts different kinds of people with different intentions. She is very vigilant regarding her safety and security.” if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[250,250],'dailytrust_com-banner-1','ezslot_2',143,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-banner-1-0');Kabir, therefore, prayed to the court to give him more time to produce his client in court.
