The former director, who hails from Kano Municipal Local Government Area, had said she decided to stop supporting Tinubu because he “hardly thinks straight.” “Yes, I am no longer supporting him (Tinubu); that is why I left the party. A lot has changed. He can hardly think straight.  I am very sure of that. You can see his clips. “I have transcended religious, tribal or regional sentiments, so I can’t afford to look at things with that narrow premise. I think it is not only irresponsible, it is criminal because we have succeeded in dividing this country for selfish reasons. We can’t continue like that. We need to move our country forward. That is my reason. I have nothing personal against anyone,” she had said.
