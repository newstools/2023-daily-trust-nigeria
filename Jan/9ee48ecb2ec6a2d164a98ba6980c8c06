The Katsina state gubernatorial candidate of the New Nigerian People Party (NNPP) has promised to run an Islamic-based system of government if elected in March. Speaking at the Media Trust Town Hall Meeting on Saturday, Dr. Rabe Darma, deputy governorship candidate, who represented his party, said if the system is adopted by the end of 2023, the fight against corruption will end in the state, as there will no more corruption. While attacking the current administration, he promised to improve revenue generation that will provide more than the federal allocation the state is receiving. “We will adopt an Islamic based system of government which will be according to the teachings of Prophet Muhammad PBUH. The system will address all the challenges we are facing in the country.
