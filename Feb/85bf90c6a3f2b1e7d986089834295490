The presidential candidates of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu; Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar; Labour Party (LP) Peter Obi; New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso; and 14 others have been charged to strictly adhere to the peace accord they signed on Wednesday in Abuja. Addressing a press conference yesterday in Abuja, a former lawmaker and Protem Secretary General of the National Coalition for Peace and Unity (NACOPU), Dr Cairo Ojougboh, commended the candidates for signing the accord and asked them to abide by it. He said, “As a body dedicated to the ideals of promoting unity, peace and harmony, with membership from all over the country, we reaffirm our commitment to work with all concerned to collectively achieve peace and credible elections in 2023. “The candidates and their political parties should not just end their quest for peace at the signing of the peace accord, but should take a step further to ensure that their supporters are educated on the need for peaceful polls and a peaceful nation. “They should send a strong message to their supporters all over the country to ensure that they conduct themselves properly during the elections and avoid any form of violence during and after the elections. “Opinion polls are not the actual polls, they can be deceptive. Supporters should not be carried away by them. Opinion polls cannot equate to results of the real polls and therefore should be taken with a pinch of salt because if not properly handled could result in post-election violence by party supporters.”
