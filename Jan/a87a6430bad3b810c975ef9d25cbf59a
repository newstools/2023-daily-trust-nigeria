We were four in the car when the terrorists came out from nearby bush to shoot at us. They are eight in number which I counted and they surrounded the car shooting from all corners. “The driver manoeuvred his way to dodge their bullets as the car failed to stop after they hit the car tyre. Some of the bullets hit the side of the car but I am grateful we all survived with no injury.”
