The Plateau State chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has said that it has not endorsed any candidate for the governorship election in the state. CAN’s state Chairman, Polycarp Lubo, in a statement, called on Christians in the state to vote candidates of their choice, noting that competent leaders should be given priority. He said, “Concerning the governorship and the state assembly elections, be enthusiastic to come and vote the candidates of your choice in the interest of Plateau State. “Vote candidates who are God-fearing; have integrity and are accountable; vote for men and women of good character who have track records and are passionate about Plateau.” He added that it was important for Plateau people to pray for the will of God to prevail in the elections rather than individuals’ will.
