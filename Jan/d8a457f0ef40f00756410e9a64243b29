Enoch Adejare Adeboye a Nigerian pastor and the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God has given his two cents as regards the forthcoming presidential election in Nigeria next month. According to the clergyman, most youths who attend political rallies are jobless and members of the crowd who participate in the activities are likely rented. In a now-viral video making the rounds on the social media space, the renowned cleric said, “I watch it in the news. If human beings promote you, oh, I don’t know whether I should say this; when you see, I am sure you have been watching the campaign rallies; I watch it in the news… “I don’t know if you have noticed that two different people do not hold their campaign simultaneously in a town. Have you noticed that? You don’t know why. It is because a majority of the crowd is rented.

After I go, another man comes, he pays, you gather. Somebody keeps on coming and says, ‘Daddy, you keep on saying you have not heard from God about who would win the election maybe because there are several things occupying my mind.” “One of it is that when I see the crowd gathering, and when you look at the crowd, the majority of them are young. When I see the hundreds of thousands of youths, you have to be jobless to be attending all these rallies. What is going to happen when the campaigns are over?”
