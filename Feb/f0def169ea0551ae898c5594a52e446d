Flying Eagles head coach Ladan Bosso, has revealed his team’s target at the ongoing U-20 Africa Cup of Nations tournament after their victory over Mozambique on Saturday. It will be recalled that Nigeria defeated the Mambas 2-0 to advance to the quarterfinals of the U-20 AFCON as the second-place team in Group A. Speaking with CAF media, Bosso said his sole aim at the competition is to ensure qualification for the FIFA U-20 World Cup later this year by reaching the tournament’s semi-finals in Egypt. “We came to Egypt with the mindset of picking one of the tickets to the FIFA U-20 World Cup and the victory against Mozambique is something that we planned. “We worked for it. We have seen them play about two matches in Cairo. “We tried to rush them and we did just that and got our two goals in the first half. In the second half we introduced other players preparing them for the next stage,” he said. Speaking further, he hailed Defender Solomon Agbalaka, who won the Man of the Match award for the second game in a row after his goal gave the Nigerians their first win against Egypt. “It is expected [MOM award] because he’s somebody that I heard of and I had to leave Abuja to Lagos on two occasions to watch him play for his team,” the coach said. They will now face the winners of Group B in the quarterfinals at the Suez Canal Stadium at 6pm on Thursday, March 2nd.
