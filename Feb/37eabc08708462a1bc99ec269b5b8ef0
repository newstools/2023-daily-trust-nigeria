QNET, a multinational direct-selling company operating in multiple regions globally in partnership with Transblue Nigeria Limited, a  customer service compliance, and logistics company has engaged the media to fight the spread of misleading information designed to defraud unsuspecting Nigerians. Speaking at a media roundtable yesterday, the Group Chief Communication Officer, QI Group, Ramya Chandrasekaran, said QNET has a positive social impact across the world and has recently seen some criminal elements hiding behind its brand name to offer non-existent job opportunities to Nigerians. Chandrasekaran said: “This is not good for society, QNET adding that the company’s aim is to build entrepreneurial skills that will enable Nigerians to earn commission and add value to society.” She said QNET has leveraged technology very early on in its operation to deliver value to its customers worldwide. The Managing Director TRANSBLUE, Abdulhakeem Ajisafe Abiodun said: “The partnership which commenced in April 2022 has seen QNET leverage its offices in Lagos, Abuja and Port Harcourt as well as its call centre to enable Nigerians to track purchases, lay complain and follow up with resolutions.
