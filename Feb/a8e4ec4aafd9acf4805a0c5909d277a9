The management of Silver Cross Hospital, Abuja, on Monday, organised a free medical outreach for no fewer than 40 orphans in the FCT. The Chief Medical Director of the hospital, Dr Patrick Ezie, said the outreach was to provide comprehensive healthcare services to children at the Holy Family Sisters of the Needy Home for Orphans and Vulnerable Children in Bwari Area Council. Ezie said, “We brought this medical outreach to the children in this orphanage to show them that we love and care for them. “This is the month of Valentine and it is time for us to show love not only to our families, but to the less privileged and most vulnerable among us. “We are also aware of the financial constraint faced by most of these orphanages in taking care of the children’s feeding, not to talk of their healthcare. “On our part, we will be doing our best to ensure that the children remain healthy by providing periodic checks and treatments to them.” He called on well-meaning Nigerians, philanthropists and corporate organisations to reach out to orphans during the season of love and even beyond. In her remarks, the sister in-charge of the orphanage, Chioma Ugwu, thanked the hospital’s management for the gesture. She said, “Even in this time of economic difficulties and cash crunch you still remembered us and showed us love and care. We want to say a big thank you.” The services rendered included laboratory tests for various illnesses, deworming, drugs, as well as donation of other medical consumables. (NAN)
