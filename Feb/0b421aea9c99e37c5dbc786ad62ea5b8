The Supreme Court has resumed proceedings after a break over the naira redesign and swap policy brought against the federal government by some states. The seven-member panel led by Justice Inyang Okoro admitted Abia State as the 12th state co-plaintiffs after counsel to the Attorney General of the Federation, Tijani Gazalli (SAN), agreed to concede to Abia’s fresh application to join, which he earlier said was not ripe as the office was served in the court. Counsel to the Attorney General of Abia, Udochi Iheanacho Esq, had pleaded that the originating summons to join and a consolidation application be taken alongside other motions from other states. However, the Attorney General of Lagos State, Moyosore Onigbanjo (SAN), raised an objection to the continued participation of the Attorney General of the Federation, whom he said was in contempt of the court.

The presiding justice of the panel, Justice Okoro assured that every application, including the preliminary objections by the AGF will be heard as the apex court was not willing to be made scapegoat. “You are not a stranger in this country as you are a participant,” he said. “We don’t want a situation where the Supreme Court will be made a scapegoat. We refuse to be made scapegoat.” “If you have contempt application, we will hear it; everything in court, we will hear,” he added.
