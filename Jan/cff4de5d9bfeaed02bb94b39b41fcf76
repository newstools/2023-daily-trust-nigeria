The presidential candidate of Labour Party (LP), Mr Peter Obi, has taken a swipe at his political opponents, saying the presidency of Nigeria is not a retirement home for anybody. He also said the leadership of the country is not a turn-by-turn affair but for people with the capacity and character to lead. Obi stated this in Awka, Anambra State, during a town hall meeting with traditional rulers at government house, Agu-Awka on Tuesday. He said if the leadership of the country is taken turn by turn, it is his turn as the most qualified person. “I have the capacity, character, mental well-being and energy to do the job. “When you look at me and my running mate’s age, you would discover that we are young compared with the other candidates, who are older, and our national chairman is in his 50s, but the national chairmen of the other candidates are in their 70s. “When you talk about qualification, I am the most qualified and the youngest among them and this is not a job for rehabilitation of people because Nigeria needs a strong and vibrant person as president and one that is in tune with the trending and modern style of leadership,” he said. if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[250,250],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_3',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[250,250],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_4',151,'0','1'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0_1'); .box-4-multi-151{border:none !important;display:block !important;float:none !important;line-height:0px;margin-bottom:15px !important;margin-left:auto !important;margin-right:auto !important;margin-top:15px !important;max-width:100% !important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px;padding:0;text-align:center !important;}According to Obi, if he is elected president of the country, he will secure and unite Nigerians for good, noting that the country is not secured and united today.
