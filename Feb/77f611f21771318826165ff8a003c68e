National President, Road Transport Employers Association of Nigeria (RTEAN), Musa Muhammed Maitakobi, has enjoined members of the association not to allow themselves to be used as political thugs to promote violence in the forthcoming general elections. He gave the charge in Abuja during the National Executive Council meeting of the association. He also urged them to remain law-abiding and eschew conduct capable of disturbing public peace. He said the association would not endorse any presidential candidate despite overtures by several political parties. “We’re not endorsing a presidential candidate, because the RTEAN constitution does not allow us to have or demonstrate a form of preference among people contesting elections. Our constitution does not recognise ethnicity, religion and politics. “Any member of RTEAN, anywhere you find yourself, don’t allow yourselves to be used for touting, political thuggery and hooliganism.” Meanwhile, National, zonal and state leaders of RTEAN have passed a vote of confidence on Maitakobi for providing “purposeful and satisfactory leadership” since he assumed office in 2020. They commended him as sole candidate for the forthcoming RTEAN National Delegate Conference slated for April, saying he deserved re-election for his remarkable success in office since October 2020 as well as uniting RTEAN and introducing initiatives that had improved the local economy of the association.
