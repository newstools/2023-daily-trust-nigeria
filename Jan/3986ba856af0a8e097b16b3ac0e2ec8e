The Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, Malam Muhammad Bello has assured that the Abuja Light Rail will resume service before the end of his administration in May. Bello gave the assurance when he featured the 20th Edition of the President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration scorecard series organised by the Federal Ministry of Information and Culture on Monday in Abuja. “Another important milestone achievement of President Buhari’s administration is the infrastructure development of the Abuja Light Rail. “When we came in 2015, about 52 per cent of the project was done and we pushed it to 100 per cent. “And many of you will want to wonder why the Abuja Light Rail is not working; it is not working now because of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. “We had to stop the operation because as you know the light train system basically is a mass movement, so if you don’t have much sitting capacity, many people will stand up and when you stand up, you face each other. “So, it was obviously very difficult to maintain social distancing but we are done with all that; the carriages are here and by the grace of God before May 29, we will resume.” if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[336,280],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_3',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');The minister disclosed that about 12 stations had been completed and about five of them and the roads were still under construction.
