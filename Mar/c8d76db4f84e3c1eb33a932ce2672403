The Governors of Nasarawa and Kwara states, Abdullahi Sule and AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, respectively, have cautioned against violence before, during and after the March 11, governorship and Houses of Assembly elections. Gov Sule spoke in Lafia during a meeting with the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Jama’atu Nasril Islam (JNI), Justice Sidi Bage-Mohammed (Rtd), Emir of Lafia and chairman of the state’s traditional council. He said the government would not tolerate a religious crisis in the state on account of the elections and called on all stakeholders and the electorate to be peaceful in their conduct. He said, “Nasarawa State has always been seen as a peaceful place, and there are Muslims and Christians in virtually every family. So, the government cannot allow a religious crisis in the state.” Similarly, Governor AbdulRazaq has called on members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kwara to vote peacefully during Saturday’s elections. AbdulRazaq, who spoke yesterday during a meeting in his Adewole ward in Ilorin West LGA, called on party supporters to be peaceful and wary of opposition elements who might want to disrupt the electoral process. He said, “Don’t resort to violence. We shall win these elections in sha Allah. Go out and canvass for votes from all eligible voters in the state to guarantee the success of the party come Saturday.”
