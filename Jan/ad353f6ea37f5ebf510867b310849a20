Yiaga Africa has urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to consider the extension of the January 29, deadline for the collection of the Permanent Voter’s Card (PVC). The Executive Director of Yiaga Africa, Samson Itodo, made the call yesterday in Abuja at the “Yiaga Africa Watching the Vote” media roundtable on the 2023 general elections. Itodo said, “Sufficient PVCs have not been collected. INEC should consider further extension of the PVC collection to enable people to collect their PVC because Nigerians are determined to vote in the next elections. “And we at Yiaga Africa; what we are doing is providing information, public education and ensuring that people have the information that is required to participate in elections. Insecurity: Stakeholders ask INEC to recruit locals as ad hoc staff Why there is low PVC collection in some states – INEC “We also want to limit election manipulation through trade analysis, protect the integrity of the 2023 elections to data-driven election observation and provide technical support to marginalised groups which are on the ballot for the 2023 elections, especially women, youths and persons with disability.” if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[250,250],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_3',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');In his goodwill message, the President of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Chris Isiguzo, urged the media to avoid propelling fake news from social media and other unverifiable sources.
