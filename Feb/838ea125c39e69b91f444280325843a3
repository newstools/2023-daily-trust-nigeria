Struggling Nasarawa United face an uphill task today as they take on unbeaten Bendel Insurance in the Nigeria Premier Football League (NPFL) week 8 fixture at the Samuel Ogbemudia stadium in Benin City. The Group A match offers the ‘Arsenal of Benin’ the opportunity to extend their unbeaten run to eight matches but their guests are in a desperate search for their first away points in the current season. After five losses and one draw, Nasarawa United managed to win their first match when they defeated Kwara United 2-0 last Sunday, the same day 3SC forced Insurance to a 2-2 draw in Ibadan. On current form, Insurance who are on top of Group A with 17 points are highly favoured to win their sixth match while Nasarawa United with a paltry four points from one win and a draw in seven matches are firmly rooted at the bottom of the table. In other midweek matches billed for today, Niger Tornadoes who lost 2-0 at Sunshine Stars will seek to bounce back to winning ways when they host Bayelsa United in Kaduna, Doma United 0-1 losers at Enugu Rangers will welcome Abia Warriors at the Pantami stadium just as another week seven loser, Gombe United will travel down south to seek revival at Akwa United. Elsewhere, Group B leaders, Lobi Stars who squeezed past Dakkada 2-1 in their last match will make a short trip to Bauchi where they are to face Wikki Tourists who forced Abia Warriors to a 1-1 draw in Aba, Plateau United who secured a point at Remo Stars in a 1-1 draw will welcome El-Kanemi Warriors to the New Jos stadium in the northern derby while Enyimba who are still basking in the euphoria of their 2-1 away win at Gombe United host 3SC in Aba. And newly appointed coach, Kabiru Dogo, will make his debut with Kwara United when the ‘Afonje Warriors’ host Remo Stars at the Lekan Salami stadium in Ibadan while embattled Dakkada FC who surrendered the three points to Lobi Stars in their last match in Jos play host to Sunshine Stars, 2-0 winners over Niger Tornadoes last Sunday in Akure.
