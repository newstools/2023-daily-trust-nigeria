 Current and past winners of the gold label Okpekpe international 10km road race and Access Bank Lagos City Marathon will lead the Nigerian elite cast at the first Cross Country race in Nigeria scheduled to hold on Saturday, February 18, at the Rhino Golf Course in Jos, Plateau State. The race which is going to feature over 200 runners will be the first organised Cross Country event in Nigeria in over four decades. Top on the list of athletes who have registered for the race is Nyango Gyang Boy, the first Nigerian finisher at the 2023 Access Bank Lagos City Marathon held last weekend in Lagos. Also confirmed for the historic race in Jos are Iliya Pam, the best Nigerian finisher at the 2018 Access Bank Lagos City Marathon and Paul James Pam who won the 10km race at the same event this year. Emmanuel Gyan Gwom, the 2019 Okpekpe race ‘Nigerian’ winner will also be competing in Jos as well as Stephen Joshua Dalop who has also registered for the event. Veteran distance runner and multiple Nigerian 5,000 and 10,000m champion, Deborah Pam Badung has also confirmed her participation. Project Coordinator, Tony Osheku, has expressed satisfaction with the response shown by Nigerian elite athletes and believes the Cross Country event will help the athletes to get physically and mentally stronger. “Running Cross Country will make our distance runners better and stronger. In this way, they can, in a few years time, start challenging the east Africans for places in the international circuit and earn some good money which will help their career, their families and of course Nigeria,” said Osheku.
