The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has explained why some states are witnessing low turnout of prospective voters for the collection of the Permanent Voter’s Card (PVC) in some states. INEC National Commissioner and Chairman of the Outreach and Partnership Committee (OPC), Prof Kunle Ajayi, told newsmen on Wednesday in Abuja that the off-season elections held in 2022 contributed to low PVC collection in the affected states. Prof Ajayi spoke in an interview with newsmen during a national dialogue with Nigerian women groups and candidates with the theme: “2023 Elections: Women’s Participation in PVC Collection and Election Day Processes”, organised by INEC’s gender and inclusivity department in collaboration with IFES. He explained that, “There are states where elections were held in 2022. In states like Ekiti, Osun and Anambra, voters have already collected their PVCs because of off-season elections. So, you don’t expect much from there. But we are appealing to voters nationwide not to wait till the last minute. Collect your PVCs now. FCTA flags off campaign on PVC collection 2023: PVC not solution, but your senses, SDP presidential candidate tells Nigerians “Women are a major power bloc and a voting force to contend with in the forthcoming general elections. With the power of your PVCs and the opportunity of the coming elections, there is an avenue for women to change the narrative, speak with one voice and grasp the mantle of leadership in their favour.” On her part, INEC’s acting Director, Gender and Inclusivity, Lakunuya Dorothy Bello, said the dialogue was aimed at encouraging women participation in politics and ensuring they collected their PVCs to enable them vote on February 25 and March 11.
