A non-governmental organisation, Anamero Idofe Foundation, has paid the fees for the 2023 Senior Secondary School Examination Council for 1,049 students in Edo North Senatorial District of Edo State. The founder of the NGO, Mr Anamero Dekeri, while presenting the letters to the beneficiaries at Ogute in Etsako East LGA, said the number was increased from 1,000 to 1,049 students this year. Dekeri, a candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for Etsako Federal Constituency, said the gesture was to reduce the burden of payment on the beneficiariesâ€™ parents. He added that the gesture was borne out of concern for the indigent students who needed to write the foundational examination this year. One of the beneficiaries, Hakimi Sulaiman, commended the foundation for the scholarship.
