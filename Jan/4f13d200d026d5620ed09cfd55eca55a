The House of Representatives is making moves to maximise the utilisation and economic potential of gum arabic to increase revenue generation for the country. The House passed a bill for second reading on Thursday, sponsored by Mohammed Tahir Monguno, titled “A Bill for an Act to Establish Gum Arabic Research Institute; and for Related Matters”. Monguno said gum arabic is a high source of revenue, as could be seen in other countries such as Sudan. He added that it is important for Nigeria to develop the gum Arabic value chain, especially considering the need for revenue from the export of profitable commodities.
