Over 250 golfers made up of professionals, amateur players, ladies, Chief Executive Officers and members of security organisations featured in this year’s Armed Forces and Remembrance Day tournament. The tournament which was held on January 12-13 at the Tukur Yusuf Burutai (TYB) Golf and Country Club in Abuja was hosted by the Defence Headquarters in collaboration with the Nigerian Golf Federation (NGF). The Chief of Defence Staff, General Lucky Irabor, who was represented by the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Isiaka Oladayo Amao, performed the ceremonial tee-off. The CAS noted that the tournament was important to the Armed Forces as it afforded the military the opportunity to remember its fallen heroes who paid the supreme prize as well as those who are still alive and are contributing to making the country safer. “The essence of the kitty is to also be able to generate small funds for those that are still living to assist them and also tell the nation that in as much as we are fighting a war, we also keep fit in the course of fighting a war,” Amao said. The president of NGF, Otunba Olusegun Runsewe, thanked the Chief of Defence Staff for approving the partnership which he said will help foster harmonious civilian-military relationships. Runsewe, who is also the DG National Council for Arts and Culture (NCAC), noted that the golf federation had succeeded in using the kitty to bring new innovations in how tournaments are organised in the country.
