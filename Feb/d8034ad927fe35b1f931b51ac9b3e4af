Sheffield United are reportedly close to being bought out by Nigerian billionaire Dozy Mmobuosi in a deal worth £90million. The Blades are pushing for promotion back to the Premier League this season but were hit by a transfer embargo last month amid financial difficulties. The EFL confirmed on its website that their issue relates to the non-payment of a transfer fee that was owed. They say that the embargo, which prevents them buying a player for the next 18 months unless they win promotion, was imposed because the Blades failed to keep up payment instalments on signings. This included payments to Liverpool for forward Rhian Brewster, who was signed in October 2020 for £23.5m but has failed to live up to expectations or his price tag. It has been known for some time that the Blades could be sold with current owner HRH Prince Abdullah bin Musa’ad bin Abdulaziz Al Saud struggling to maintain the funding needed to keep the club going. Last year, American businessman Henry Mauriss, who was previously linked with taking over Newcastle, had a bid, understood to be over £100m, accepted by the club’s hierarchy. However, their problems are reportedly about to be eased by the takeover by Mmobuosi, a Nigerian tech entrepreneur whose company Tingo has been valued at around £7billion. The Times report that Mmobuosi is the subject of the EFL’s owners’ and directors’ test at present but no problems have been flagged so far.
