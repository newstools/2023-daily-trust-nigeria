President Muhammadu Buhari was on Saturday lauded by the workforce and the unions of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) for a recent salary increase after 15 years of stagnation. The Board and the management of NPA had called out workers for Long Service and merit award ceremony held in Lagos where the staff expressed appreciation to Buhari, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr Boss Mustapha, the Ministers of Transportation, Mu’azu Jaji Sambo and Prince Ademola Adegoroye. Also extolled by the workers were Labour and Productivity Minister, Dr Chris Ngige, and the NPA Managing Director/CEO, Muhammed Bello Koko for their initiative and approval of the wage raise. No fewer than 387 staff bagged long service awards out of which 11 emerged Best Employees of the Year (2022) in the merit award category, seven got special recognition awards while two senior staff — Mr Nelson Ovbude of Delta Port, Warri, Delta State and Mr Jibril Buba of Tin Can Island Port, Lagos bagged the Best Port Manager Awards. The cleanest port award went to One Port, Rivers State. Lagos State Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu was represented at the event by the Commissioner for Transportation, Dr Frederick Oladeinde. Speaking at the occasion, Mustapha, commended the phenomenal revenue generation drive of NPA as an essential revenue earner for the government under the management of Bello Koko, adding that the exponential growth informed Buhari’s approval of salary increase for workers. The NPA MD, Bello Koko, commended the SGF, and the ministers for their efforts in securing President Buhari’s approval for breaking the 15-year salary stagnation.
