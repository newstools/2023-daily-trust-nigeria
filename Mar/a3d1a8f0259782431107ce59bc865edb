The Supreme Court has upheld the nomination of Akanimo Udofia as the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the March 11 governorship election in Akwa Ibom. In a unanimous decision by a five-member panel on Tuesday, the apex court struck out the appeal by Senator Ita Enang against his nomination. In the judgment read by Justice Kudirat Kekere-Ekun, the panel held that Udofia is a bona fide member of the APC having secured the party’s waiver to contest the May 26, 2022 governorship primary. Enang had challenged the verdict of the Court of Appeal in Abuja, which agreed with Udofia’s contention that Enang lacked the locus standi to file the suit. The panel led by Justice Williams Daudu also ruled that the amended originating summons at the Federal High Court was filed outside the mandatory constitutional period of 14 days after the cause of action.
