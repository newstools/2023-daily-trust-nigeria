A Federal High Court in Abuja has ordered the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) not to suspend or expel Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers state from the party. Justice J. K Omotosho ordered that “all parties in this suit shall maintain peace and shall not take any action or step or act that may make the outcome of the Motion on Notice dated and filed 2nd February 2023 nugatory and worthless.” Justice Omotosho, while ruling on an ex parte application, also directed the service of hearing notice on the respondents in the matter by pasting the documents at the party’s secretariat at the Wadata Plaza in Wuse Zone 5, Abuja. Wike had, through his counsel, J.Y. Musa, brought the motion against the hierarchy of the PDP, which included the PDP, the National Working Committee (NWC), the National Executive Committee (NEC), and National Chairman of PDP, Dr Iyorchia Ayu, National Secretary PDP Senator Samuel Anyanwu and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). By the motion, the applicant prayed for an order maintaining the status quo and staying all actions in this matter relating to the threat to suspend or expel him pending the hearing and determination of the originating motion.
