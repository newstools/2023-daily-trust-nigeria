The Court of Appeal in Owerri, Imo State, has barred the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) from conducting a rerun primary election of the PDP for Aboh Mbaise/ Ngor Okpala Federal Constituency. The immediate past governor of the state, Emeka Ihedioha, is from Aboh Mbaise/Ngor Okpala. A Federal High Court in Abuja had, last week, nullified the PDP primary election for the federal constituency, which produced Albert Agulanna as the winner and ordered a rerun within 14 days. But Justice Rita Pemu, who sat on an appeal filed by Uzoma Ugochukwu against PDP, INEC, Bede Eke and Albert Agulanna, ordered that the proposed rerun primary election be halted pending the hearing and the determination of the applicants’ appeal before the Supreme Court.
