A yet-to-be-identified woman was on Tuesday morning hit by a motorist around NNPC Junction along the Kubwa-Zuba Expressway, Abuja. The woman, said to be in her mid-twenties, was crossing the ever-busy road when she was hit. A witness, Isaac Rufus, said the driver of the vehicle, an ash-coloured Mercedes-Benz, was coming from the Dei-Dei axis. “The woman was dropped by a man said to be her father at the NNPC junction close to the pedestrian bridge. While crossing to the other side of the express, she was hit by a vehicle,” the witness said. Confirming the incident, Roseline Sule, an operation officer with Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Dutsen-Alhaji Command, said the woman died on the spot. “This morning, a father dropped his daughter at the junction where there is a pedestrian bridge. She didn’t use it. She was crossing the express and a car knocked her off and immediately she died. “Inasmuch as there is a pedestrian bridge, it should be used. I don’t understand why commuters would want to use the express. Is it faster? For me it is not,” she said.
