Leading telecommunications and digital services brand, Globacom, on Tuesday, January 24, received glowing commendations from several stakeholders in Kano including the state government and the Emir, Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero, on the ongoing customer-reward promo, Festival of Joy. The traditional ruler represented by the Dan Amar of Kano, Alhaji Aliu Harazimi, presented the key of a brand new car to the latest car winner in the promo. He commended Globacom and its Chairman, Dr Mike Adenuga, Jr, for the several empowerment initiatives the organization has rolled out since inception. “It is worthy of note that Globacom has not forgotten to reward its loyal customers in Kano and across Nigeria. This culture of empowerment is commendable and sets a good example for corporate Nigeria”, the Emir said. The car prize was won by Kano-based businessman, Anas Yusuf Adamu. “I first got a call in the evening from the Glo office that I had won a car. I almost did not believe it because my phone was switched off all day. When they however told me to come to the Gloworld office on Murtala Mohammed Way in Kano, it dawned on me it is real. “ Kano State Commissioner for Finance, Alhaji Adamu Fanda, equally lauded the efforts of the telecommunications giant in giving out so many valuable prizes to its subscribers in Kano State. “Globacom is setting a good example of what corporate citizenship should be. The company is indeed demonstrating its commitment to its operating environment. I encourage them to keep it up”, he advised.
