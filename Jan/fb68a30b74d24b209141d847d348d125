Portuguese table tennis star, Marcos Freitas, yesterday dashed the hopes of Aruna Quadri at the 2023 World Table Tennis, WTT Contender in Doha, Qatar after inflicting a 3-1 (5-11, 11-7, 11-9 and 13-11) defeat on the reigning African champion in the round of 32 in the Men’s singles category. It could be recalled that the poster boy of Nigerian table tennis, Quadri rated 14th in the world, exited the WTT Contender in Durban, South Africa at the quarterfinal stage after losing to Ukraine’s Yaroslav Zhmudenko 3-0 (11-8, 11-7, 11-3). Freitas, listed as the number two seed in the Men’s singles behind Brazil’s Hugo Calderano- winner of the WTT Contender Durban, began his contest against Quadri with a defeat but won the three other sets to secure a spot in the round of 16. The Portuguese will battle against Chinese’s tennis star Zhou Qihao today.
