 The Association of Licensed Telecoms Operators of Nigeria (ALTON) has announced the commencement of harmonised short codes across all networks pursuant to a regulatory modernisation initiative by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC). The harmonisation of shortcodes is aimed at implementing a streamlined process for common shortcodes across the industry, by making life easier for Nigerians through the memorisation of single codes, for various services across all networks as well as providing a cohesive regulatory framework that is consistent with global best practices. “Following the directive from NCC, the Association hereby inform the general public that the Network Operators have begun implementing the shortcodes,  working closely with the NCC. The Commission has provided adequate time for subscribers to get used to this new development. We are confident this will enhance customer experience across networks,” a statement by ALTON said on Tuesday. The statement signed by ALTON chairman Engr Gbenga Adebayo and Head of Operations Gbolahan Awonuga said during migration which is to be concluded by 17th May, 2023, old and new common codes will run concurrently, after which the old codes will cease to operate.

Credit Recharge – 311. Data Plan – 312 Share Services – 321. Data Plan Balance – 32. Verification of SIM Registration/ NIN – SIM Linkage – 996. Porting Services (MNP) – 2442
