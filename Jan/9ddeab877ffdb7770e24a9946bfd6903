The Transmission Company of Nigeria, TCN, has announced a rise in power transmission capacity to 8,100 megawatts (MW) in seven years. Spokesperson of the company, Ndidi Mbah, yesterday said: “TCN’s wheeling capacity had increased from about 5000MW in 2016  to 8100MW and growing, through the diligent implementation of NEGMERP.” Although TCN now boasts of 8,100MW wheeling capacity and the Generation Companies can produce 7,600MW, the highest electricity ever distributed on the grid is 5,801MW on March 1st 2021. Currently, the grid wallows between 4,500MW and 3,500MW. Under the Nigerian Electricity Grid Maintenance Expansion & Rehabilitation Programme (NEGMERP) in 2022, TCN imported over 40 power transformers including the ones for five new substations in Abuja, rehabilitation of substations in Lagos and new substations in Kano and Katsina. “TCN’s wheeling capacity as simulated by its system planning department is 8,100MW and since the simulation was carried out, TCN has continued to expand the nation’s grid, by rehabilitating and upgrading brownfield/existing projects and building new/ green field projects. “TCN’s operational capacity at 8,100MW and growing is backed by facts and empirical data. TCN is not claiming that it has resolved all the challenges that impact its operations as the manager of the transmission grid, but it is resolute in its expansion drive,” the statement noted. It added that the projects are in various old or new substations nationwide, from the North to the South, to the East and West.
