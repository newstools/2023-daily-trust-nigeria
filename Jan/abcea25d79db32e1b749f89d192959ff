The National Rescue Movement (NRM) has filed a suit against the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi before a Federal High Court in Abuja over his alleged dual citizenship. The suit is asking the court for an order compelling the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to disqualify Obi from the presidential race on the ground of alleged breach of sections 1 and 137 of the Nigerian Constitution, 1999 after he accepted an honorary citizenship of Dallas in Texas, United States of America. The suit by the party, through its counsel, Mohammed Danjuma, asked the court to compel INEC not to recognise, or afford Peter Obi any right or privilege to stand for the presidential election on February 25. When the matter came up on Monday, Justice Inyang Ekwo ordered service of the originating summons on the defendants. He thereafter fixed February 10 for mention of the suit.
