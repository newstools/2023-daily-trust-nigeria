 The All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential campaign rally has been postponed in Taraba State for the third time. Our correspondent reports that the postponement of the partyâ€™s rally earlier slated for today is as a result of lack of venue. The state Publicity Secretary of the party, Aaron Artimas, who confirmed the postponement to our correspondent, said a new date would be announced later. He cited lack of venue for the rally as the main reason for the postponement. The Chief Press Secretary (CPS) to Governor Darius Ishaku, Iliya Bekye, confirmed that the Jolly Nyame Stadium earlier secured for the APC rally would be used for a state function today.
