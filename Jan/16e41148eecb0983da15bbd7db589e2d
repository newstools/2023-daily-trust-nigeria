A Federal High Court in Abuja has dismissed a suit seeking the disqualification of the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, over the issue of the Muslim-Muslim ticket ahead of the February 25, 2022, polls. Justice Ahmed Ramat Mohammed on Wednesday ruled that the lawyer who filed the suit lacked the locus standi since he was neither a member of the APC nor a participant in the process that produced Tinubu and his running mate, Kashim Shettima, as candidates. The suit was filed by an Abuja-based lawyer, Osigwe Ahmed Momoh, seeking an order nullifying the candidature of Tinubu and the APC from participating in the presidential election on the ground that the nomination of the Muslim-Muslim candidacy was unconstitutional and against the spirit and letters of Sections 14, 15 and 224 of the 1999 Nigerian Constitution. Free Trade Zones attracted over $30bn investments to Nigeria – Buhari ‘Bad belle’ prevented Abiola from becoming president – Obasanjo Momoh argued that the Muslim-Muslim candidacy ran counter to the spirit of national cohesion, integration and unity. He asked the court for an order of perpetual injunction restraining the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) from publishing the name of APC and its presidential candidate for the 2023 elections.
