The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, has asked the electorate in Ebonyi State to reject the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, on February 25 because his party jettisoned restructuring. Recall that APC had promised to restructure the country and even set up a restructuring committee headed by Kaduna State governor, Malam Nasir El-Rufai, but later stopped the process. Addressing party supporters and stakeholders in Ebonyi State yesterday, Atiku promised to implement restructuring and devolve more powers to the states, adding that “APC has abandoned the issue of restructuring. “They are a very deceitful party. We are committed to it and we mean it. So, give us the support. We are going to deliver.
