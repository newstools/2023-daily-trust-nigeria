A former Governor of Sokoto State and leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state, Senator Aliyu Magatakarda Wamakko, Sunday said that there was no reason whatsoever for the people of the state to vote for the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) again. Wamakko stated this while addressing the crowd that attended the APC rally in Bodinga LGA. He said, “The PDP government has failed the people of the state in all ramifications. Tell me what they have done for the people of the state. Is there anything they have done for our youths or women or other segments of our society? They have done nothing. They don’t deserve your votes again.” Also speaking, the Minister of Police Affairs, Muhammadu Maigari Dingyadi, said the ruling party in the state had failed woefully, citing its semi-urban water scheme in some LGAs which he claimed were commissioned but still not functioning. He, therefore, called on the people of the state to ensure that the PDP was voted out of power in the forthcoming elections. On his part, the governorship candidate of APC, Ahmed Aliyu, said if elected into office he would focus on eight areas of human development, including security, education, water supply and local government autonomy. The Chairman of the party in the state, Isa Sadiq Achida, said they were in Bodinga not to campaign but to thank residents for their assured support to the party. if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[250,250],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_3',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[250,250],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_4',151,'0','1'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0_1'); .box-4-multi-151{border:none !important;display:block !important;float:none !important;line-height:0px;margin-bottom:15px !important;margin-left:auto !important;margin-right:auto !important;margin-top:15px !important;max-width:100% !important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px;padding:0;text-align:center !important;}Our correspondent couldn’t get the PDP’s reaction, but recall that Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal said recently that his administration had performed very well and urged the electorate to vote massively for the PDP during the March 11, poll. Tambuwal had said, “We thank the people of Sokoto State for ensuring our victory in 2019 which made us remain in the government house. We thank God that the people of the state are witnessing the massive good work of our administration in the state in terms of infrastructure, agriculture, education, youth development, among others. “I also want to assure you that Mallam Sa’idu Umar will continue to build upon our achievements when he assumes office in 2023 by the special grace of God.”
