The Kwara State Police Command has commenced investigation into the case of Sergeant Simon Sylvester Ejembi who allegedly assaulted a medical doctor who he claimed examined his wife without his consent. Spokesperson of the command, Ajayi Okasanmi, told our correspondent on Tuesday that, “We have commenced investigation into the matter, and if found wanting, the concerned officer will be tried and punished in accordance with police rules.” Sgt Ejembi, who City & Crime gathered, allegedly pounced on the doctor, leaving him with a battered face. The development sparked a protest by resident doctors and consultants in the general hospital where the incident happened on Sunday. The medical practitioners subsequently declared a 48-hour strike on Monday which lapsed Wednesday over the incident. The Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) Chairman in the state, Dr Abdulkadir Ahmed, noted that the officer’s action was coming less than two months after a similar case at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital (UITH) which was still in court. He explained that, “This latest incident occurred at the obstetrics and gynaecology unit of the General Hospital, Ilorin. The man brought his wife at about 12pm with a complaint that she was sick. “Following necessary questioning and examination, treatment was administered and she was discharged to go home, only for the husband to come back later in the day to attack the doctor, claiming that the doctor did not get his consent before carrying out an examination on his wife.”
