Following Nigeria’s 4-0 annihilation of Tunisia in the third-place play-off of the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations, head coach Ladan Bosso hailed his team, stating that they performed better on Friday because they took their chances. Prior to playing at Cairo International Stadium on Friday, the Flying Eagles were defeated 1-0 by The Gambia in a semifinal match on Monday that featured numerous missed opportunities. On Friday, however, Ibrahim Muhammad opened the scoring in the ninth minute, with Ahmed Abdullahi adding in the opening minute of the second half before Jude Sunday added two more in the game for a 4-0 victory. The Flying Eagles’ performance in the games against The Gambia and Tunisia, according to the Nigerian coach after the victory, was what separated them from the other two contests. “Today we’re back in a better mood than after the semi-final match so we want to thank everyone that has been behind us,” Bosso in his post-match conference. “The difference between today’s match and that of the semi-finals against The Gambia is just the finishing. “Today Tunisia kept the ball more but they have loopholes in their defence line so we played the ball behind them to cause them problems.”
