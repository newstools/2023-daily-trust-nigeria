His Grace, John Cardinal Onaiyekan, Catholic Archbishop Emeritus of Abuja, has cautioned politicians against any attempt to rig the forthcoming general elections. Onaiyekan, who spoke on Saturday during the celebration of his 40th anniversary as bishop at the Holy Trinity Church, Maitama, Abuja, said, “With the current yearnings of the people for a better country, the elections will no longer be business as usual. “As regards to the results of the elections, politicians should desist from any form of manipulation to their favour if not voted for. “All those who are planning to play games and schemes to rig in order to frustrate the desires of the people as regards the results of the elections should desist from such.

It won’t be business as usual anymore. “I want Nigerians to know that they can no longer keep quiet all the time, hoping that things will change, that God will work miracles.” Onaiyekan advised Nigerians to use their voter’s cards to express their minds.
