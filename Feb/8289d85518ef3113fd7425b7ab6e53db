A new opinion poll conducted by the Nigerian Human Rights Community has indicated that the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, will win the February 25, poll. The group, consisting of 134 organisations, at a press conference addressed by its Secretary General, Taiwo Adeleye, in Lagos yesterday, projected that Tinubu would win based on the analysis of the preferences of 19,365 persons that its researchers surveyed in January. It said, “The Nigerian Human Rights Community poll revealed that the presidential candidate of the APC, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, holds a magnificent lead and is on course to win the 2023 general elections.” The group explained that the poll also confirmed a two-horse race for the second position between Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Peter Obi of the Labour Party (LP), while Rabiu Kwankwaso of the NNPP came a distant fourth.
