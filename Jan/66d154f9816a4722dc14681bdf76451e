The Kogi State chapter of the APC Presidential Campaign Council yesterday said it was not moved by the “hired crowd” that welcomed the presidential candidate of PDP, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, to Lokoja, the state capital, during a rally. Kinsley Fanwo, the Director of Media and Publicity of the state APC Campaign Council, at a briefing yesterday in Lokoja, described the purported defection of over 148,000 members of the party to PDP as ridiculous and lies from pit of hell. Fanwo added that those the PDP claimed to have defected from APC were members that have committed certain offense or lost favour of their colleagues and became liability to the government and APC. He assured that Kogi APC would deliver the state for the party’s presidential candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, in the general elections.
