The National Chairman of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Alhaji Musa Gabam, has said that only the National Working Committee (NWC) members of the party have authority to determine its direction with regards to elections and related matters and therefore asked the party’s candidates to stop making unapproved comments. In a statement on Wednesday by the National Publicity Secretary of the party, Ambassador Rufus Aiyenigba, the party stated that no member or candidate of the party was authorised to make any commitment on behalf of the party without the NWC’s approval.
