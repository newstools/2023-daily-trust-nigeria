Supporters of the president-elect, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, have cautioned leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the Labour Party (LP) against further protests over the outcome of the February 25, polls, saying such will lead to a breakdown of law and order. Tinubu’s supporters, under the umbrella of the “The Natives”, made this known on Monday during a demonstration against the continuous protests by the opposition and their supporters over the president-elect’s victory. PDP leaders had protested at the headquarters of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Abuja, while LP leaders are planning to besiege INEC offices nationwide over lack of access to certified true copies of electoral materials used for the conduct of the election which Tinubu won.
