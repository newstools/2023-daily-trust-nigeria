College men basketball team, Louisville Cardinal have announced the addition of forward/center Emmanuel Okorafor to the roster for the current 2022-23 season. Okorafor, a 6-foot-9 prospect from Lagos, Nigeria, will join the team this week and be eligible to compete immediately as a freshman. “We’re fortunate to have one of the premier players coming out of NBA Africa to be a part of what we’re doing here at the University of Louisville. “Emmanuel is one of the bright stars coming out of NBA Africa. He’s versatile, strong, a great rebounder and excellent running the floor. We’re blessed to have him. “The global impact of what NBA Africa is doing – to go out and target the young, bright stars of the continent of Africa and bring them into their facility – is vital not only to the continent, but to the world. It’s great for our program to be connected to the work they’re doing,” UofL head coach Kenny Payne said in a statement made available to Daily Trust. Okorafor joined NBA Academy Africa in May 2021 and enrolled full-time in March 2022. NBA Academy Africa – one of four NBA academies around the world – is an elite basketball training center in Saly, Senegal, for the top high-school age prospects from across Africa. It will be noted that last year, Okorafor was one of 12 NBA Academy prospects chosen to participate in the Basketball Africa League’s Elevate program. if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[300,250],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_3',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');The BAL, a professional league launched by FIBA and the NBA, aims to provide an opportunity for the next generation of African prospects to showcase their talent on a global stage.
