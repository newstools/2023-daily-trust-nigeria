The Police Command in Ogun State has deployed armed personnel to strategic locations around the state to forestall post-election violence. This, the police said, became imperative to prevent any act of breakdown of law and order in the state following the announcement of the Presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu as the winner of the last Saturday election. There has been fear of violent protest by residents, especially youths who are believed to be against the victory of Tinubu at the polls. But, leading his men on a patrol on Wednesday, the Ogun state commissioner of police, Frank Mba, warned against any planned protest, saying the police would not condone any act that could breach the peace of the state.
