The Rivers State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has said it has complied with the necessary laws by paying the sum of N95 million for the use of public facilities for its open-door campaigns in the state. The party said the payment was in compliance with the precautionary requirement of N5 million per venue stipulated by Executive Order 21 issued last year by the Rivers State government. A statement yesterday by the chairman of the Publicity and Communications Committee of the Consolidation of the New Rivers Vision Campaign Council, Chief Ogbonna Nwuke, disclosed that PDP was merely living by example and wished other political parties to follow suit. He said the party had received official approval from the office of the Commissioner for Education, Professor Prince Chinedum Mbom, entitling it to use facilities owned by the state government. Recall that Executive Order 21 prescribes the payment of N5 million by political parties as precautionary fees for the use of facilities such as schools, among others. Part of the letter conveyed to the PDP in the state reads, “I hereby acknowledge receipt of your deposit of the total sum of N95,000,000 only into the state government account, being the required precautionary deposit for the use of your indicated public school facilities in Rivers State. “Sir, Sequel to your compliance with the directive as contained in our letter dated 6th December 2022, I hereby convey to you, my approval of your request for the use of state-owned schools’ facilities as indicated in the annexure to your application.”
