Nigerian young football sensation, Collins Toshor, is eying a permanent deal with his present club TJ Banik Kalinovo in Slovakia’s third division. The combative defensive midfielder who joined the club on loan from FK Kosicka Nova Ves has posted eye-catching performances and is optimistic he will sign a permanent deal when his loan contract expires in June. The 21-year old Toshor who left Ukraine for Slovakia at the outbreak of the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia joined TJ Banik Kalinovo on loan in September 2022. Speaking to Daily Trust on phone, the Benue State born talented youngster said there are positive signs that he will be signing a permanent deal at the end of the current season. He hinged his confidence on the increasing interest shown in him within the short period that he has played for the club. “TJ Banik Kalinovo signed me on loan from a lower division club FK Kosicka Novas Ves in September 2022 until June this year but we are discussing a permanent deal because it has been going well since when I teamed up with them. “I am enjoying steady progress in my professional career and my new club has been most supportive. Since my arrival, I have not had any cause to regret my decision to play for them. “Therefore, I am trusting God that in June, the existing cordial relationship between my parent club and TJ Banik Kalinovo will yield positive results for me to concentrate fully on rendering my professional services,” said Toshor. He also expressed his desire to represent Nigeria in future as he said “I have the potential to play for the Super Eagles. I believe my time will come.”
