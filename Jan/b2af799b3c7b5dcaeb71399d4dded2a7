The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) House of Representatives Aspirants Forum has described the endorsement of the Labour Party (LP) presidential candidate, Mr Peter Obi, by former president Olusegun Obasanjo as a ruse, saying it will not take Obi anywhere. The forum, in a statement yesterday jointly signed by its national chairman, Hon. Danjuma Mohammed, and national publicity secretary, Hon. Jibrin Keana, told the leadership of the party not to lose sleep over the endorsement, but to focus on the conduct of the election. 20 rice farmers feared dead in Kebbi boat mishap DSS nabs ISWAP kingpin behind Ohinoyi palace, kuje prison attacks They said the facts and figures on the ground have shown that the PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, would win the election if it is conducted in a free, fair and transparent manner. “Atiku Abubakar has done well as the vice president under a performing government of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo and he has done well for himself as a liberal democrat, an employer of labour,” they said.
