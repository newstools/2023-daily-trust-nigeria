Several persons sustained injuries in a clash between two rival cult gang members of the Eiye and Aiye confraternities in the Shibiri area of Lagos The clash, which started from the waterside area of Etegbin, later escalated towards Ajagbadi and assumed a frightening dimension as the hoodlums went after one another with weapons. Already, 11 suspects have been arrested and they have been moved to the State Criminal Investigation Department (SCID), Yaba, on the orders of the state Commissioner of Police, Abiodun Alabi Sources said that the fracas started when some Aiye members trailed a member of Eiye to a drinking joint at the Etegbin waterfront. The source said the gang was identified as one of those involved in the killing of one of their members. Lagos police spokesman, Benjamin Hundeyin, could not be reached as he was said to be in a meeting.
