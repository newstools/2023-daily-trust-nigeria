A mild drama played out on Wednesday afternoon at LEA Primary School, Kubwa II, one of the wards used by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to distribute permanent voter cards (PVCs) to those that register in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). A witness, Ogundipe Kemi, told City & Crime that trouble started when one of the men, popularly called ‘Bobby’ was accused of collecting bribes from people unwilling to go through the chaotic collection process at the ward. “Collection of PVC is not easy in this ward. This is the third time I am coming for collection. Some people come here as early as 4am to write their names, and yet they still have to wait for hours before they are attended to or asked to come back the next day.

The young man noticed how Bobby had been collecting tips from people to help them get their PVCs with ease at the detriment of others who were there earlier. “He approached Booby on the issue, and a fight ensued. It took the intervention of a security personnel before the collection process continued,” Kemi said.
