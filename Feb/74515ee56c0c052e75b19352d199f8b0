The Disciplinary Tribunal of the Pharmacy Council of Nigeria, PCN, has tried 10 erring pharmacists in Lagos for misconduct, misappropriation of funds, manufacturing of questionable pharmaceutical products and breach of trust among others. The Chairman of the Governing Council and Disciplinary Tribunal, Prof Ahmed Tijjani Mora, who stated that sanctions would range from fines to striking out of the names of the registered pharmacists for a number of years, urged all registered pharmacists to adhere strictly to the ethics of the profession as contrary practices would incur the wrath of the Council. The tribunal which adjourned till next month for continuation of trial and judgment on nine pharmacists, reprimanded the one other who pleaded guilty to the charge brought against him. Registrar of PCN, Pharmacist Ibrahim Babashehu Ahmed, who disclosed the verdict of the tribunal, stressed that definite judgement would be passed on the nine other pharmacists at the next sitting. “One pharmacist was reprimanded at the end of the day. The remaining cases were adjourned for definite trial and the decision is to ensure that the tribunal reconvenes in March, to ensure that definite pronouncements are made with respect to those cases,” he said. Pharmacist Okwum Chinedum Samuel, who pleaded guilty to the charge of misconduct and agreed to make a refund, urged the council to ensure proper orientation for newly inducted pharmacists.
