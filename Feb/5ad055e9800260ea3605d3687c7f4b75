 Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) in the country have been urged to campaign against electoral violence and play critical roles that will safeguard the sanctity of the country’s democracy. Addressing newsmen at the weekend in Abuja, convener of the Civil Society Coalition for Transparency and Good Governance, Nse Victor Udoh, said CSOs should not go into activities that would jeopardise the February 25 and March 11 elections. He said, “Their activities should be on how to help INEC to educate voters, how to respect the sanctity of the ballot box and violence-free elections. “It will be a disservice to endanger peace, to endanger democracy. We call on citizens to come out en mass and vote. CSOs should stop dabbling into core politics and blackmailing people but promote values that promote democracy.”
