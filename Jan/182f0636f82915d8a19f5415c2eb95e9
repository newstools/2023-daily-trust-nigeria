A new swab test is set to offer hope for women suffering from a painful, chronic condition that can cause infertility. Endometriosis develops when endometrial-like cells similar to those lining the inside of the uterus (endometrium) begin growing in other areas or organs of the body. But the revolutionary swab test takes just four weeks to produce a result – enabling treatment to be given early and reduce the chances of infertility. Endometriosis causes severe discomfort in the ovaries and other parts of the body and until now has taken, on average, eight years to be diagnosed in the UK. It causes cells similar to the lining of the womb to grow in other parts of the body, often causing severe pain. The swab test will be available privately in the UK this month at about £1,000. But there are hopes that it will be rolled out in the NHS. Jo Sinclair, of patient support organisation Fertility First, said: “It’s a very small investment for the NHS relative to the years of misery many women suffer.” – Mail Online
