Marcus Rashford has said he wishes Manchester United could “play today” to “put things right” after Sunday’s 7-0 Premier League loss at Liverpool. However, Rashford, 25, said the squad must ensure the match does not “define their season”. “I wish we could play a game today to try and put things right,” the forward tweeted. “The result is the result, and we can’t see past that! We must not let it define our season. We have to trust the process and stick together.” The loss equalled United’s heaviest defeat and is their worst result against Liverpool. Their three previous losses by seven goals came against Blackburn Rovers in 1926, Aston Villa in 1930 and Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1931.
