Mohamed Salah is now Liverpool’s record goalscorer in the Premier League era. The Egypt international scored his 129th top-flight goal for the Reds against Manchester United on Sunday, taking him to the summit as the club’s most prolific player in the division. Salah moved ahead of Robbie Fowler, who plundered 128 Premier League goals across his two spells at Anfield, with Steven Gerrard (120) in third place. Michael Owen remains in fourth position on the list having netted 118 times in the league, while Sadio Mane’s tally of 90 sits him fifth. Salah’s outstanding achievement came as he scored twice in Liverpool’s sensational 7-0 defeat of fierce rivals United at Anfield, his 205th appearance. The No.11 opened his Premier League account for Liverpool at Watford in August 2017 having completed a transfer to the club from AS Roma earlier that summer. He would go on to total 32 in the division during that debut 2017-18 campaign, winning the Golden Boot for the first of three occasions to date (also in 2018-19 and 2021-22). Nineteen of his top-flight haul were registered in the 2019-20 season to help Jürgen Klopp’s side clinch the Reds’ first championship success for 30 years.
