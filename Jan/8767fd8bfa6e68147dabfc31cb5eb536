About 250 locally made technological products which can generate hundreds of billions of naira for Nigeria have been presented to local and foreign investors by the federal government. The technological products, all developed by Nigerian scientists at the Federal Institute for Industrial Research Oshodi (FIIRO), were presented on Tuesday during FIIRO Day at the ongoing Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) Expo taking place at the Eagle Square in Abuja. “We have conducted cutting edge research on some raw materials readily available in Nigeria leading to the development of not less than 250 technologies, resulting in the creation of profitable enterprises which invariably has led to the generation of jobs through its multiplier effects, thereby reducing poverty and earning of foreign exchange”, the FIIRO Director General Dr Jummai Adamu said. Jummai who presented the products said FIIRO had focused on Research & Development (R&D) activities that are market-driven, and demand-oriented and could move Nigeria from an import dependent to sustainable self-reliant and production for exports. “We call on investors and other relevant partners to invest in our cutting edge R&D products, goods and services and also collaborate with us to support our dear nation to achieve its diversification agenda of moving from consumption to production economy through effective utilisation of Science, Technology and Innovation in the shortest possible period,” she added. She said Nigeria’s mono-economy dependence on oil and gas, which is non-renewable, had kept the country away from meaningful development that would have made it respected among the comity of nations. The DG listed some of the institute’s technological products including the Development and Production of High Nutrient Biscuits for School Age Children; the Development and Production of Ready-to-use Therapeutic Foods for the Management of Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM); Nutraceuticals for the Management of Diseases such as Sickle Cell Anaemia-Research and Commercialisation; Development of Antilipemic/Hypolipidemic from Selected Fruits for the Management of Obesity; Utilisation of Neem Extracts for Production of Neem Skin Care/Oral Hygiene Products; and Development and Production of Fibre-Enriched Bread.
