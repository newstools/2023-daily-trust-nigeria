Labour Party has dissolved its State Executive Council in Rivers State with immediate effect. Julius Abure, national chairman of the party, who announced this in a statement on Tuesday, said it is as a result of anti-party activities and corruption in the management of party’s funds. “Those who were at the helm of affairs in Rivers State when our presidential mandate was openly stolen in Rivers State should step aside until full investigation is completed on what happened on that day,” Abure said in the statement. He added that he had lost confidence in the ability of the executive council under Deinye Pepple to lead the campaign for the March 11 governorship and State House of Assembly elections. Pepple had earlier announced that Labour Party in the state had endorsed governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Siminialayi Fubara, for Saturday’s election. But Abure asked the party supporters to disregard the comment and work for the victory of Beatrice Itubo, the party’s governorship candidate. The chairman also said the Labour Party has not formed an alliance with any political party.
