The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Presidential Campaign Council (PCC) has denied claims that the party’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar is ill and has been flown abroad. Senator Dino Melaye, the Director, Public Affairs of the PDP Presidential Campaign Management Committee in a statement Sunday said Atiku is very fit and only travelled abroad on the invitation of the British government. An online medium had reported that Atiku, a former vice president had been flown from Dubai, United Arab Emirates to London for treatment. The medium, which quoted sources close to the campaign council also reported that the PDP candidate was yet to resume the campaign ahead of the February 25 poll because of his ill health. But Melaye said, “Nigerians should henceforth disregard drug-induced statements propelled by Ikebe super like online medium.” He also called on Nigerians to disregard “The lies of unrepentant liars. Atiku Abubakar is hundred per cent fit and in super form healthwise. The British government invited the leading presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, just like they had invited Bola Tinubu and Peter Obi earlier.”
