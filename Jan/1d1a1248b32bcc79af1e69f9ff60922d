The Country Director of Redemption International for the Blind (RIFTB), Ayuba Isa Waziri, has expressed worry over what he termed the unconcerned attitude of the various political parties in the country toward carrying them along in the forthcoming general elections. Waziri, who spoke with Daily Trust, yesterday, in Jos, the Plateau State capital, said despite the clamour for political participation from all and sundry, they are still not treated as they should be. He said the attitude of the political parties was further exhibited towards them recently when they invited all the gubernatorial candidates in the state for a parley to discuss their manifestos, but none honoured the invitation. The development, according to him, showed that politicians and political parties treated certain categories of people in society with disdain and levity.
