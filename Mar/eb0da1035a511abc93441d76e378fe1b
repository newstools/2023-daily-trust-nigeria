The Director General of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Presidential Campaign Council and Governor of Plateau State, Simon Bako Lalong, has described the victory of Bola Ahmed Tinubu in last Saturday’s elections  as an act of God. Lalong, in a statement in Jos yesterday, said Tinubu’s victory vindicates his many years of hard work, perseverance and commitment to the democratic development of Nigeria. The governor said the APC has proved that it is a party that has diversity and acceptance among Nigerians of all persuasions. While commending INEC for conducting a credible election despite the few challenges, Lalong also advised candidates and political parties who have complaints to use legal means provided by the constitution to ventilate, rather than inciting citizens to engage in any act that could jeopardise the peace and security of the nation. He said Tinubu’s election would usher in a new vista in the nation as they have promised to ensure peace, unity, justice, equity and fairness to all Nigerians irrespective of their backgrounds.
