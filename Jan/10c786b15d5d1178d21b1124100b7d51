As this year’s general elections draw nearer, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has warned its ICT personnel against manipulation of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS). The Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in Plateau State, Dr Oliver Tersoo, gave the warning yesterday during a demonstration session on the configuration of the BVAS, to the REC and ICT personnel, at the headquarters of the commission in Jos. Addressing the staff of the commission during the exercise, Dr Tersoo called on the ICT personnel saddled with the responsibility of the configuration of the machines to maintain a high level of trust, loyalty and commitment to their job. He said any attempt to exploit the machines would tarnish the image of the commission, emphasising that they shouldn’t betray the trust bestowed upon them. Malam Salisu, an INEC  staff from Abuja who anchored the demonstration session, also told the ICT personnel to be diligent in their work as everyone would be paid for their job. Recall that INEC took delivery of its last consignment of the BVAS machines on Wednesday.
