The leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Oyo State have assured the presidential candidate of the party, Atiku Abubakar, of victory in the state despite opposition by members of the G-5 governors, which included the state governor, Seyi Makinde. The leaders, who met in Ibadan to announce some of the activities lined up for the presidential campaign of Atiku in the state, maintained that the decision of Makinde and the G-5 not to work for Atiku over the party’s national chairman, Dr Iyorchia Ayu, would not in any way affect its chances at the polls. Makinde, Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, Samuel Ortom (Benue), Okezie Ikpeazu (Abia) and Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi (Enugu), have hinted that they would work for another presidential candidate ahead of the poll. However, the leaders of the PDP in Oyo, who included a former minister for Mines and Steel, Wole Oyelese; a former minister of state for the Federal Capital Territory, Jumoke Akinjide; and a former deputy governor of the state, Hazeem Gbolarumi, argued that Atiku is the most prepared to rescue Nigeria from its present state and deliver dividends of democracy to the masses. Similarly, Jonde Jam Fulani Youth Association (JJAFUYAN), Tuesday also endorsed Atiku ahead of the February 25 general poll. The group, led by its national president, Alhaji Sa’idu Mai-Kano, at a press briefing in Jos, said they took the decision following the realisation that Atiku was the only candidate that knew the problems of the Fulani in the country.
