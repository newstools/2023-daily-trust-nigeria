He said, “Notwithstanding the obvious challenges that were associated with the election and the concerns expressed by aggrieved stakeholders, the SDP hereby aligns with the final choice that has been made, and as freely expressed by the Nigerian people across the divides, and we stand by the outcome of the electoral process. “We commend the INEC under the leadership of Prof. Yakubu Mahmood for pulling through in the face of all odds. The election has been won and lost. Going forward, therefore, and what is right in the true interest of our country, is for all grievances to be expressed through the appropriate channels and very responsibly.”
