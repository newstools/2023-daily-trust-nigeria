At the Hotoro area of the state where the president went to commission the Muhammadu Buhari Interchange, youths also took to the streets after the president had departed and were pelting the convoy with stones, a situation that led the security operatives in the convoy to fire warning gunshots into the air and later fire teargas canisters to disperse to gathering mob. Daily Trust gathered that after the security left the scene, the youths started bonfires at different locations on the road. There were similar protests after the president commissioned some projects in Katsina last week. After the Katsina incident, Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje wrote to the president to reschedule his planned visit, citing discontentment as a result of the fuel scarcity and the new Naira notes policy of the apex bank as a security threat. However, the governor backtracked after the president ordered for the extension of the deadline for the old Naira notes.
