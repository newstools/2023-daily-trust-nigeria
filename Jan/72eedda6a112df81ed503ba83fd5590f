Former Wales captain, Gareth Bale has announced he will play in a PGA Tour event just weeks after retiring from professional football. Bale said he will compete in February’s AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am in California. The 33-year-old retired earlier this month as Wales’ most-capped male player and record men’s goalscorer. The tournament takes place between February 2 and 5. In addition to other amateurs, Bill Murray, Jason Bateman, and Macklemore will compete at a California event with a $9 million (£7 million) prize pool. Bale will be attempting to draw attention after switching from football clubs to golf clubs. The former full-back and winger, who amassed 111 caps for Wales, earlier declared that football was his favourite sport. “Delighted to announce I will be playing in the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am at the start of next month! Let’s go,” he posted on social media on Monday. A five-time Champions League winner with Real Madrid, Bale’s relationship with the Spanish giants suffered when he was pictured with a banner that read ‘Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order’ while on international duty with his country in 2019. if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[580,400],'dailytrust_com-banner-1','ezslot_1',143,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-banner-1-0');There will be 156 amateurs participating at Pebble Beach and the same number of professionals, including US Open champion, Matt Fitzpatrick, world number five Patrick Cantlay and three-time major winner Jordan Spieth.
