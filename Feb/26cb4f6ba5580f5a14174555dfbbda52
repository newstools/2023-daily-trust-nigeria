The Code of Conduct Bureau yesterday said it would monitor public officers who would be participating in this year’s general elections for any infraction. The chairman of CCB, Prof. Isah Mohammed, said this at a briefing in Abuja. He said anyone that did not comply or breach the CCB Act would be accordingly dealt with. He said this is the first time the CCB will be deploying its staff in the 36 states and the FCT for monitoring public officers in an election, noting that it is to ensure President Muhammadu Buhari leaves a legacy of free, fair and credible elections. “In sum, we shall observe whether or not a public officer in this exercise has put himself or herself in a position where his or her personal interest conflict with the duties and responsibilities assigned to him or her; “Observe whether or not an officer in this exercise asks for or accept any benefit of any kind in the discharge of his or her duties,” he said.
