The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) says it has perfected plans to introduce emergency marshals to work in different communities in the six area councils to curb hazards. The administration said the measure was to help manage the adverse effects of the rapidly growing population in the nation’s capital. The director general, FCT Emergency Management  (FEMA), Alhaji Abbas Iddris, noted that the agency had carried out hazard mapping in Abuja, identifying areas where urgent attention was required. He noted that the decision to introduce emergency marshals was based on the need to increase life-saving interventions and also mitigate hazards.

These are volunteers who assist students, hospital workers and PWDs, and other public servants during emergencies. “They also assist in facility services, risk management and safety services by reporting conditions in a building that could present a hazard during an emergency. “They also maintain an orderly evacuation; conduct a sweep of an area to ensure that evacuation is complete. “The marshals are also to participate in debriefings resulting from evacuations and complete a monthly checklist for fire safety in their areas,” he said.
