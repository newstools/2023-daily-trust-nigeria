The United States Tennis Association and the US Open are “hopeful” world number one Novak Djokovic will be allowed to play this month’s Indian Wells and Miami Masters events. The 22-time Grand Slam winner, 35, has applied for special permission because he is not vaccinated against Covid-19. The US requires international visitors to be vaccinated and a proof will be required until at least 10 April. Djokovic missed last year’s US Open because of his vaccination status. Indian Wells and the Miami Open start on 6 and 20 March respectively. He also missed last year’s Australian Open and was deported from the country because of his vaccination status.
