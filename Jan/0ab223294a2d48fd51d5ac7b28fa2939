Presidential Candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has said he would tackle insecurity and improve the nation’s economy if elected. Tinubu, a former governor of Lagos State, said he would confront the problem of insecurity from all angles, including introducing technology, recruiting more personnel into the army and police and engaging in training and re-training of personnel. He said,” If there is employment opportunities, good education and other opportunities for advancement, security would improve. I commit to realising the immense opportunities inherent in the Lekki Deep Sea Port, the first new sea port in decades, which is more than 90 per cent completed.” A statement on Thursday by Tinubu’s Media Aide, Tunde Rahman, quoted the APC presidential candidate as saying he would build an even more prosperous economy and review the operations of railway in the country during his consultative session with FOCI held at Wells Carlton Hotels in Abuja.

These will enhance efficiency, support industrial growth, spur trade and investment, and improve the Ease of Doing Business. “My commitment to increase annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth will heavily depend on the quality of the infrastructure we shall build to facilitate and sustain growth in all facets of our national life. “We must work together and collaborate to look at the bottlenecks impeding the realisation of the full potential of the construction industry and take realistic efforts to address them,” Tinubu said.
