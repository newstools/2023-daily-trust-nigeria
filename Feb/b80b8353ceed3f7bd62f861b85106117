The Registrar of the National Examinations Council (NECO), Prof. Dantani Ibrahim Wushishi, has said that seven states from the North owe the examination body over N2 billion. He made this known while announcing the 2022 External Senior School Certificate Examination at the councilâ€™s headquarters in Minna, Niger State on Thursday. The registrar who refused to disclose the states explained that the initial debt was over N3 billion but with the efforts of some state governors the balance was reduced to a bit above N2 billion. He said the debt was affecting the council in the conduct of examination as it relied on what it generates from the payment of examination fees to pay its examiners.
