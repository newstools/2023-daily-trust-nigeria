The Director, FCT Sports Department, Mr. Luka Istifanus, has said plans are underway to revamp all mini-stadia in the six area councils of the FCT. The Director who made the disclosure while reacting to the 9th place finish of Team FCT at the last edition of the National Sports Festival in Asaba, Delta State, said the sporting facilities, if revamped, would enhance sports development in the territory. It will be recalled that for the first time in history, FCT finished in ninth position on the medals table away from Abuja. The Head, Media and Communications Unit of the Department, Vivian Onubogu, quoted the director as saying each time the sports festival was staged outside Abuja, Team FCT finished around 16th to 19th position on the medals table. Istifanus , therefore, expressed optimism that at the next festival to be held in Abeokuta, Ogun State, FCT would target seventh place finish. He reiterated that with early and adequate preparations, it will be possible for FCT to finish among the top seven at the next edition of the sports festival. “We shall do everything possible to work on the lapses we noticed at the last edition of the sports festival in Asaba. FCT won’t rest on its oars in a bid to finish among the top seven in Abeokuta. if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[336,280],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_3',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');“Since we are opposed to poaching of athletes, we shall continue to organise grassroots tournaments where we would discover budding athletes. “When discovered, our well trained coaches would groom them for national and international competitions,” he assured.
