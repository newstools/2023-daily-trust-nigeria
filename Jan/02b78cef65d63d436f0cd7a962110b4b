Amid the growing list of countries imposing travel restrictions on China over COVID-19 surge, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) representing airlines globally has cautioned against what it called “knee-jerk reinstatement” of restrictions which it said have proved “ineffective” since the virus started. IATA director general, Willie Walsh, stated this amid the growing concerns over the surge even as authorities in Nigeria have put Nigerians on the alert. Daily Trust reports that several countries in Europe have imposed travel restrictions on China. Morocco and Ghana from Africa have also joined in imposing restrictions even though Nigeria is yet to decide whether to impose the restriction. But IATA DG advised the government to work with experts and avoid taking irrational decisions like travel restrictions which would not curb the spread. 1,533 cases pending in Kwara – Chief Judge NIS rescues 6 trafficked victims in Jigawa eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_2',151,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_3',151,'0','1'])); .box-4-multi-151{border:none !important;display:block !important;float:none !important;line-height:0px;margin-bottom:15px !important;margin-left:auto !important;margin-right:auto !important;margin-top:15px !important;max-width:100% !important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px;padding:0;text-align:center !important;}According to IATA in an electronic mail, research undertaken around the arrival of the Omicron variant concluded that putting barriers in the way of travel made no difference to the peak spread of infections. At most, restrictions delayed that peak by a few days. If a new variant emerges in any part of the world, the same situation would be expected. President of Aircraft Owners and Pilot Association, Capt. Alex Nwuba, in a chat with Daily Trust said Nigeria should not rush in imposing any restriction except there are fresh cases linked to China.
