The presidential candidate of the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP), Kola Abiola, has told the Kebbi electorate that his priorities are to create jobs for Nigerians, empower women and youths. Abiola who spoke during his campaign visit to the state urged the people of the state to vote for him and other candidates of the party in the general elections to enable them to restore security and link the state with railway lines, which he said was already in THE Nigerian map. He said, “I am standing before you today because of my integrity and humble background. In our party, we don’t have fake presidential candidates, governorship candidates or senatorial candidates. We are party men and women who are ready to discharge good leadership to all Nigerians.” The PRP presidential candidate said he would fulfil all his campaign promises to Nigerians if elected. He said, “Your security will be our priority. Take your PVCs, vote for PRP candidates from the state to federal levels. I came from a background where creation of jobs and empowerment of women are priorities. We will fulfil our promises to you.” Earlier, his running mate, Hazo Haruna enjoined Kebbi people to vote for PRP, saying the party would end corruption, insecurity and “oppression currently bedevilling the country.”
