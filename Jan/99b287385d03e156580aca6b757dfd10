The Department of State Services (DSS) says it has intercepted some syndicates in parts of the country for allegedly selling the newly redesigned Naira notes. This was contained in a statement issued by the agency’s Public Relations Officer, Dr Peter Afunanya, on Monday in Abuja. He said the syndicate was intercepted by operatives of the service during an operation. “Investigation has also shown that some Commercial Bank officials were aiding the economic malfeasance. Consequently, the Service warns the currency racketeers to desist from this ignoble act. “Appropriate regulatory authorities are, in this same vein, urged to step up monitoring and supervisory activities to expeditiously address the emerging trends,” the PRO said.

The DSS spokesman, therefore, urged anyone with useful information relating to the sales of the new currency to pass the same to relevant authorities. (NAN)
