A final year student of Modibbo Adama University, Yola in Adamawa, Raudah Sheik-Jimeta, says she rakes in N80,000 monthly from the sales of local seasoning and spices. Sheik-Jimeta, who stated this in a telephone interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday, said she produced a variety of spices sourced from local produce. “I started dealing in spices like chilli powder, ginger and garlic paste, “Daddawa” processed from locust beans, pap and dumpling powder locally called “Garin-danwake”. “I began the business in 2020 during the COVID lockdown with N30,000 seed capital because I really wanted to be self-reliant, so that I can help myself and my family,” she said. Sheik-Jimeta, an Information Technology student, said her spouse and sister motivated her to join the trade, adding that she effectively managed time by combining studies and business. “I enjoy high patronage from women who followed my products advert on social media platforms as well as friends and family members. “I made brisk businesses during Ramadan fast and festive periods,” she said, adding that she engaged two persons as the sales outreach expanded to other states. if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[336,280],'dailytrust_com-banner-1','ezslot_1',143,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-banner-1-0');“My dream is to become a household name, providing jobs for youth and women across the country,” she said.
