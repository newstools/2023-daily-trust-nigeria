Kano state government, through the Consumer Protection Council, on Sunday, shut popular supermarket, Wellcare, over refusal to accept old Naira notes. According to the Acting chairman of the council, Baffa Babba Danagundi, the supermarket was shut shortly after Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje gave the order. He said the order of the closure follows the refusal of WellCare Supermarket to accept the old naira notes from customers as against the instruction of the state government. He warned other marketers in Kano to be aware that the state government has not banned the use of old Naira notes, therefore, any shop caught not receiving the old notes will be dealt with decisively.

Kano is among the states that challenged the naira redesign policy in court. In a Suit Number: SC/CS/200/2023, the Kano State Attorney General, through his Counsel, Sunusi Musa (SAN) asked the Apex court to declare that the President of Nigeria, cannot unilaterally direct the Central Bank of Nigeria to recall the new N200, N500 and N500 old Bank notes without recourse to the Federal Executive Council and National Economic Council, respectively. Kano state Government prayed a mandatory order seeking for a reversal of the Federal Government policy to recall the N200, N500 and N1,000 notes from circulation, for affecting the economic wellbeing of over 20 million of its citizens. The Applicant also sought mandatory order, compelling the Federal Government to reverse the Naira redesign policy for alleged failure to comply with 1999 (as amended) constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.
