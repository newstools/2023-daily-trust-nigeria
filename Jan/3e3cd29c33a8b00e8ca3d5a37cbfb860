Nigeria’s largest container terminal, APM Terminals Apapa, has received the Nigeria Ports Authority (NPA) Platinum Merit Award for its excellent performance in Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) issues. The HSE award came a few days after APM Terminals was presented with the award of Terminal Operator of the Year by the Maritime Reporters Association of Nigeria (MARAN) in December. The HSE Awards is an annual event to acknowledge and honour port operators within the Lagos Ports complex that have distinguished themselves in the area of health, safety and environment compliance. APM Terminals Apapa received the highest award, Platinum Merit Award, for its continuous excellent performance at the port.

Furthermore, it enables us to be more efficient and give our customers a better experience, while adding more value to the Nigerian economy.” APM Terminals Apapa has received several commendations and honours not just for its efficiency but also for its sterling safety records. Last year, the terminal set a new safety record at the port, as it logged 500 days without Lost Time Injury (LTI). No Lost Time Injury (LTI) means no injury was sustained on the job by an employee or contractor that resulted in the person being away from work due to his or her injury.
