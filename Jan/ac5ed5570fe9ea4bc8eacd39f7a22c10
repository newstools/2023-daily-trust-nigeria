The Muslim community in Gwarinpa Estate, Abuja, has dragged the Nigeria Police to court over the alleged gruesome murder of a truck driver, Malam Kabiru Babai, by a police officer in Osun State. The group, which filed a fundamental human rights case between Balkisu Kabiru Babai vs. Police Service Commission and four others, in the Federal High Court sitting in Maitama, Abuja, on Tuesday, is demanding N2 billion in compensation for the family of the deceased. In a suit No. FHC/ABJ/CS/1292/22 before Hon. Justice A. R. Mohammed, Federal High Court, Maitama, the community is urging the court to grant its prayers to enable the widow to take care of the children. The Muslim group told the court that it decided to pursue the case for justice and fairness. Malam Babai was alleged to have been murdered by Sergeant Moses Samuel of the Osun State Police Command on the 3rd of December, 2021 at about 5pm. The deceased, until his death, was a truck driver, imam, philanthropist and breadwinner of his family. According to the report, their truck developed a mechanical fault around Ota Efun, Osogbo, Osun State, and while he was under the truck to fix it, some officers arrived, had an argument with Malam Kabiru Babai, and was allegedly killed by the police. if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[250,250],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_3',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');The body of Malam Babai was taken from the Osun police command to the mortuary at the Uniosun Teaching Hospital, Osogbo, Osun State, before he was later taken to Bauchi State for burial.
