Rivers State government has withdrawn the approval given to former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar to use Adoki Amasiaemeka Stadium, Igwurita Ali, Ikwerre Local Government Area, for presidential campaign. The campaign organisation had scheduled February 11, 2023, for Atiku presidential campaign in Rivers. Governor Nyesom Wike had a couple of weeks ago given approval for the use of the stadium for the campaign but with a condition that it would be accessed 48 hours to the event. But in a letter dated January 31, 2023, and addressed to the Director General of Atiku campaign organisation and Governor of Sokoto State, Alhaji Aminu Tambuwal, Rivers State Commissioner of Sports, Barrister Christopher Green, said intelligence revealed that Atiku campaign organisation was collaborating with the governorship candidate of APC , Arch. Tonye Cole, to accommodate and share the approved facility for the presidential campaign.
