A member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Board of Trustees and former minister under the administration of former President Olusegun Obasanjo, Professor Alphonsus Nwosu, has resigned his membership of the party, citing the party’s refusal to stick to the zoning formula. Professor Nwosu, who did not mention the party he is joining next, said his resignation was a matter of conscience and principle. According to the letter sighted by Daily Trust, Nwosu’s resignation was because of the party’s inability to respect its own constitution on power rotation between the North and South. Nwosu communicated his resignation to the National Chairman of the party in a letter dated Thursday, January 12, 2023. The letter was also copied to Adolphus Wabara, acting PDP BOT chairman, and the party chairman of PDP, Ward 1, Nnewi. The letter read: “This resignation for me is a matter of conscience and principle because of the party’s inability to adhere to the rotation provision in its (PDP) Constitution,” he wrote. “The journey to rotational presidency between the North and South of Nigeria has been a long and arduous one and I have been involved. Nigeria and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) must learn to keep to an agreement reached by a Constituent Assembly (1995); and enshrined in the Party’s (PDP) Constitution (1998).” The PDP has been enmeshed in a serious crisis since the conduct of its presidential primaries in May last year when the former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar won the ticket of the party after the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party jettisoned the zoning formula of the party.
