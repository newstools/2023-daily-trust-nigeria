The Action Alliance (AA) has threatened to stage a peaceful protest at the National Assembly in Abuja, over the alleged exclusion of its candidates from the INEC’s list ahead of the general elections. The National Chairman of AA, Dr. Adekunle Omo-Aje, during a press conference at the party’s national headquarters Sunday in Abuja, said INEC’s alleged failure to upload the names of all the candidates presented to it by his leadership despite various court orders against the recognition of the list of candidates submitted by the sacked national chairman of the party, Mr. Kenneth Udeze, might jeopardise the forthcoming elections. “We shall move to the National Assembly on a protest and to submit our protest letter and to inform our lawmakers that if the INEC Chairman, Prof Mahmood Yakubu, is not called to order, there will be negative consequential effects on the outcome of 2023 elections. “We shall use all legal channels to ensure we get justice against any form of exclusion from presenting our candidates for elections and every such election stands the chances of annulment by the law,” he said. When contacted, INEC National Commissioner and Chairman Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, said political parties should learn how to use their internal constitutional and regulatory mechanisms to resolve their internal disputes and challenges. “The commission is focused on delivering a good election. The commission is busy putting finishing touches to preparations for the conduct of the 2023 general election. The commission will not be distracted by negative comments and actions by mischief makers and fifth columnists. We urge political parties to put their houses in order and brace up for the conduct of the 2023 general elections,” Okoye said.
