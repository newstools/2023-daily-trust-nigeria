The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has cautioned Nigerians against a purported portal for the recruitment of ad hoc staff for the 2023 general elections. This was contained in a statement issued Tuesday in Abuja, by Mr Rotimi Oyekanmi, chief press secretary to INEC chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu. INEC had on September 7, 2022, announced that its official recruitment portal for the 2023 general elections (www.pres.inecnigeria.org) would be opened to the public on Wednesday, September 14, 2022, by 8 am and would be closed on Wednesday, 14 December 2022, by 8 pm. Oyekanmi, however, said the portal currently in circulation was fake as the commission was no longer recruiting for the elections since its official website for recruitment had been shut down. He said, “The website/blog below is advertising ad hoc staff positions for the 2023 general elections. However, the commission is no longer recruiting ad hoc staff for the 2023 general elections. “The INEC ad hoc staff recruitment portal was officially shut down on December 14, 2022.”
