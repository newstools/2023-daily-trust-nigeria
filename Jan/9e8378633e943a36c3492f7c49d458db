A former Senate president, Dr  Bukola Saraki, has said the attack by some gunmen on the residence of Mr Ikenga Ugochinyere, the spokesman of the Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) in Akokwa, Ideato LGA of Imo State is politically motivated. Saraki, in a statement Sunday by his media office signed by Yusuph Olaniyonu, also described the attack, which reportedly left three people dead and many vehicles and houses burnt, as sad and bad for the nation’s democracy. Part of the statement reads, “Coming a few weeks to the general elections and given the recent experiences of the CUPP spokesman and House of Representatives candidate of our great party, the PDP, Ikenga Ugochinyere, there is the general belief that the attack is politically motivated and that those who want to return the nation’s democracy to the dark era are at work.”
