The Borno State governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mohammed Ali Jajeri, has pledged to empower women and reduce the number of out-of-school children if elected. Jajeri stated this in Maiduguri yesterday when he featured on a programme: “Borno Know Your Candidates”, organised by the Peace Ambassadors Centre for Humanitarian Aid and Empowerment (PACHE). He said the problems of Borno were not building houses, but rather human development which was urgently needed to fix the problem bedeviling the state. Jajeri said, “We have many best brains all over the world, and I will bring them so that together we can restore the lost glory of Borno State. If I’m elected, I will empower women and they would be given a voice in my government to provide solutions to the problems.
