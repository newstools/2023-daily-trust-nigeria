 The presidential candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Prince Adewole Adebayo, has ruled out mergers with other political parties for the March 11, governorship and Houses of Assembly elections. Speaking in Ilorin, Kwara State, yesterday, Adebayo said the SDP was in the race to win elections not only in Kwara, but across the country. He said, “What are we merging for? We’re here to make a difference, and coupled with our hard work, we can move mountains come Saturday, March 11. “Any of the political parties can join the SDP to move the country better. But forget it, we are not joining any political party.” Adebayo, who expressed reservation about the outcome of the presidential election, said Nigeria would not move forward until all the stakeholders recognised the need to fight poverty and insecurity. He further said, “We knew all along one person would win, but it would have been better if the process was clean.”
