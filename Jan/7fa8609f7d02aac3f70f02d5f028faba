The Delta State governor and vice presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Sen Ifeanyi Okowa, has said only God can cause true change in Nigeria. He spoke yesterday in Ughelli during a Prayer Convocation and Silver Jubilee celebration organised by the Anglican Diocese of Ughelli with the theme, “You are my Battle Axe.” He said Nigerians were disillusioned that things were going wrong for the nation and urged the people to seek the help of God in turning things around for the country. The governor said, “As a country, we are crying that things have gone so bad, but the prayer of the people can move God to cause a true change to happen in our nation. 2023: Okowa tasks Omo-Agege on issue-based Campaign Why primary healthcare needs to be strengthened – Okowa “We know that with the situation in Nigeria today, only the living God can redeem us and He is the one that will lay the path and no man can change it. if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[580,400],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_3',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');“I know that I am on the ticket of the PDP as vice presidential candidate but I am not going to talk politics here.
