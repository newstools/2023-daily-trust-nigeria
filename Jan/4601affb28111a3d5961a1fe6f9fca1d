The military veterans in Ekiti State, have appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to save them from hunger and poverty. In a statement signed by the Ekiti State secretary, Alhaji Bello Oseni, Sunday, the veterans said the situation of their members had become very terrible, as some were sick and could not afford to feed themselves. The statement said, “On November 17, 2022, a sum of N134.7 billion was approved by President Buhari’s administration to pay the pensions of military veterans who fought in the Nigerian Civil War in order to take care of themselves and their families. “However, since the money was approved by President Buhari, the money is yet to be paid to us.” The veterans also urged the National Assembly, and governors, whom they commended for the approval, to have mercy on them and see that their monthly pension arrears were paid without delay. “We humbly appeal to our president and those in charge to pay the veterans and put a smile on our faces as we commemorate the 2023 Armed Forces Remembrance Day this year,” the statement added.
