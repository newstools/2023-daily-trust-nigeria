Chrisland High School, Lagos, where a student died during its inter-house sports competition on February 9, remains shut, the Lagos State Government declared on Sunday. It stated that the continued closure of the school after the death of the 12-year-old student, Whitney Adeniran, was to further investigate alleged endangerment of the students and others. “The closure of the school paves the way for unhindered investigation and afforded all stakeholders, including parents, students, staff and friends of the deceased, time to grief,’’ Commissioner for Education, Mrs Folashade Adefisayo, stated. “In view of the circumstances surrounding the death of the child, the Lagos State Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice ordered a coroner’s inquest into the matter to ascertain the cause. “The Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH) conducted the autopsy on February 15. It was conducted by Prof Sunday Soyemi, consultant pathologist, in the presence of Dr Samuel Keshinro, consultant pathologist representing the deceased’s family, and Dr Olugbenga Oyewole, consultant pathologist representing Chrisland Schools. “The autopsy report, dated March 1, revealed the cause of death as asphyxia and electrocution. “The attorney general and commissioner for justice consequently directed the Directorate of Public Prosecution (DPP) to issue legal advice on the matter. “Without prejudice to the criminal proceedings, the school will remain shut to further interrogate the endangerment of students and others,’’ the commissioner added.
