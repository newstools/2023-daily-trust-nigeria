The new board of the Professional Golfers Association of Nigeria (PGAN) is poised to celebrate its over 200 members with a professional and amateur golf tourney with a whopping N20m at stake for the pros. Professional golfer and Executive Director of PGAN, Tony Philmore, has said nothing can be more gratifying than setting aside a week in a whole year for professionals to feature in a tourney solely bearing their own image. He maintained that even as sponsorship is needed for such a huge venture, the tourney would still hold with or without the much-needed sponsorship. “We are celebrating ourselves. As much as we would gladly welcome any sponsors to add glamour to this event, we would however move ahead and pay from our purse in a situation where no sponsor shows up. This is already a task that must be accomplished,” said Philmore. According to the Media Director of PGAN, Susan Cokekotas, the PGAN Championship is slated to hold from Wednesday to Saturday at the Port Harcourt Club 1928 Golf Section. ‘This event is a very important one. It would indeed be an icing on the cake for the new board which has accomplished so much within its short period in power. This event will surely signpost a greater future for the professional game as it is currently evident that the professionals in their numbers have indicated total confidence and support for this new board,” said the avid golfer. Meanwhile, PGAN will honour two of its leading sponsors, Chief Ikenna Okafor and Dr. Austin Ndubuisi at the end of the tournament.
