 TAJBank Limited, a non-interest banking services provider, has opened a branch in Apapa, Lagos, as it expands its financial services nationwide. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), about six months ago, issued the bank a national banking license. TAJBank, in a statement at the weekend, said the opening of the Apapa branch was part of the board and management’s initiatives to open more branches within a few months across the six geo-political zones. Speaking at the opening ceremony, TAJBank’s founder and Managing Director, Mr Hamid Joda, said Apapa was targeted for the commencement of the bank’s branch network expansion in the South West because of the strategic position in the nation’s business operations and the need to offer customers real-time, technology-powered world class services. He said, “We are very excited to begin the deepening of our non-interest and customer-focused products and services in Apapa, Lagos as we commence the expansion of our services across the geo-political zones of the country. “This is a mega branch based on the investments in technologies and solutions and the quality of human resource we are putting in place here and we intend to put in other branches we are opening very soon because we intend to offer what other banks are not offering in terms of value-addition to our customers.” In his remarks, the bank’s Executive Director, Mr Sherif Idi, noted that the bank’s excellent performance had been recognised in Nigeria and other countries with the bank clinching various awards and securing acceptance by global rating agencies. Also speaking, the Managing Director and CEO of IAL Nigeria Ltd, Alhaji Ismail Adetola Lawal, commended the drivers of the bank for opening the Apapa branch for the benefit of business owners and the Nigerian economy.
