The Kaduna State chapter of the Labour Party (LP) has dismissed claims that its governorship candidate, Jonathan Asake, has withdrawn from the race and collapsed his structure for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Nine governorship candidates in Kaduna had on Monday endorsed the PDP candidate, Isa Ashiru, as the consensus candidate ahead of Saturday’s governorship election in the state. LP said its candidate was asked to step down for Ashiru but it declined. The party’s Kaduna State Director of Planning, Research and Strategy, Dr Polycarp Gankon, disclosed this at a press briefing Tuesday. He said Asake remained the best and most credible among all the candidates contesting the March 11, governorship election in the state. He stressed that LP stood on the Southern Kaduna Charter and would not be a party to any decision that perpetually placed Southern Kaduna indigenes as second-class citizens in the state. He said, “After due consultation with the Labour Party at the state and national levels, as well as looking at the voting pattern of Labour Party supporters in Kaduna State, we make bold to declare that Labour Party has not and will not go into any merger with PDP.” He, therefore, urged their supporters to disregard any public announcement or secret propaganda that Labour Party had stepped down for PDP or any other party in the state.
