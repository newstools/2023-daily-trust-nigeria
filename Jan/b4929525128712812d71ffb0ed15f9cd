Many residents of Taura LGA in Jigawa State have benefited from free medical outreach and relief materials from the Young Medical Professionals of Nigeria (YOMPON) to mitigate the impact of flooding in their communities. Dr Musa Abdurrahman Hassan, president of the association, said the medical outreach was aimed at reducing the suffering of people, who are finding it difficult to access health care services, especially those displaced by flood.
