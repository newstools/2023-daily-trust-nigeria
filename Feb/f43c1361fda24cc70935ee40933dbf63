Nigeria and the Republic of Niger have signed a bilateral agreement in Abuja for the coordination of frequency utilisation along their common border to ensure seamless deployment of services within the two countries. The agreement signing ceremony was one of the highlights of the two-day Digital Economy Regional Conference hosted by the Nigerian government and facilitated by the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy which ended at the Transcorp Hilton, Abuja, at the weekend, a statement by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), indicated. Nigeria’s Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Prof Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami, signed on behalf of Nigeria, while Nigerien’s Minister of Post and New Information Technologies, Mr Moussa Baraze, signed on behalf of his country. The Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (EVC/CEO) of NCC, Prof Umar Danbatta, and Niger Republic’s Chairperson of the National Council for Regulation of Electronic Communications and Posts, Mrs Aichatou Oumani, were witnesses to the agreement, which applies to the coordination of frequencies existing in the Nigeria-Niger transboundary areas between 87.5 megahertz (MHz) and 30 gigahertz (GHz). The agreement indicated it would help in the effective coordination and sharing of frequencies and channels in the “buffer zone or area” on borderlines between the two countries and also help to address one of the major issues of signal interference regulation that may arise in telecoms signal transmissions by terrestrial telecoms service providers as it spells out the procedures for regulating such cases.
