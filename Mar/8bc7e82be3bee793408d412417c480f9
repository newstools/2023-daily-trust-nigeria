 A hit and run driver on Sunday killed a middle-aged man on the Olooru-Okoolowo highway, before Shao Junction, in Moro LGA of Kwara State. The Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Frederick Ade Ogidan, confirmed the incident during a telephone chat with our correspondent on Monday, saying, “Two people (males) were hit during the incident and one of them died while the other sustained bruises and fractures. “The FRSC team took both the injured victim and the corpse to the General Hospital, Oke-Oyi, Ilorin.” Ogidan, who described the vehicle as a “red coloured private boxer”, implored drivers to desist from excessive speeding and reckless driving. He equally advised pedestrians and other road users to exercise patience while trying to cross highways to prevent being knocked down by vehicles.
