The presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has said 2023 is a year of hope and victory over the avalanche of challenges bedeviling the country. Tinubu, in a statement yesterday by the Director, Media and Publicity of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Presidential Campaign Council (PCC), Bayo Onanuga, said he had the best vision for the future of Nigeria. He noted that the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari had tried its best amid the challenges being faced by the country, adding that the world would watch Nigeria soar higher and higher under his watch. The statement reads in part: “Every vote is a testament of renewed hope; the certainty of victory over poverty and the conviction that our country carries within its bosom the potentials of the world’s next super power, indeed, the first black super power. “The coming administration of APC under the leadership of Asiwaju Tinubu and Senator Kashim Shettima, when elected, by the goodwill of Nigerians, shall put an aeroplane on the tarmac already built by President Buhari that will take us at supersonic speed to our destination. The world shall watch Nigeria soar higher and higher.”
