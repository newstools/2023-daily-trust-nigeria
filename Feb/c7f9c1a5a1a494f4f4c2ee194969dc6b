 Over 655 athletes from 24 athletics clubs in Nigeria yesterday jostled for medals in the first leg of the maiden Lagos Athletics Club Series at the Yaba College of Technology (YABATECH) Sports Complex in Lagos. The one-day tournament organised by the Lagos State Athletics Association (LSAA) saw former national 100m champion, Enoch Adegoke and national women 400m champion, Patience Okon-George and other star athletes competing for laurels. Also, a product of Inter-house sports competition of International School in Lagos, Femisola Mohammed achieved a personal best (PB) at the event as the teenage sensation ran 57.72secs as PB in the women’s 400m. An elated Mohammed said her achievement is a motivation for her to work harder as she said she never thought of achieving a new PB of 57.72secs in the women’s 400m. “I am so excited to compete in this competition because I just came to be part of it not expecting to run a PB and I am so happy that I was able to run my PB here for the first time which is a motivation for me to continue to work harder,”she said. In the women’s 200m, an upcoming athlete Ada Bright dusted some of the top athletes in one of the finals of the women’s 200m with 24.6secs. The LSAA Technical Director, Enefiok Udo-Obong, said the turn-out was impressive for the first leg while hoping that more athletes would join up as the tournament moves to the second leg next month.
