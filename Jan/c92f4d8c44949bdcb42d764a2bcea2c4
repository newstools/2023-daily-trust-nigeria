Primary school teachers of the Local Education Authority (LEA) in Kuje Area Council of the FCT, on Tuesday, embarked on an indefinite strike action. The strike is coming a day after public and private schools resumed in the nation’s capital. The teachers said the strike was due to the failure of the council chairman, Abdullahi Suleiman Sabo, to reach agreement with their union’s leaders. The chairman of the Nigeria Union of Teachers (NUT) in the council, Comrade Audu Lucky, declared the strike in a press statement signed by four union executives, which was issued to newsmen. He said the union observed with dismay the non-compliance of the council chairman to address the backlogs of the teachers’ unpaid entitlements. According to him, the demands included payment of salaries to teachers that were recruited in 2018, which he said were abruptly stopped by the council chairman in September, 2022. He said teachers that were reabsorbed as permanent staff worked from January to December 2022 without salary. if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[300,250],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_3',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');“In view of the above, the union leadership is calling on all LEA primary schools teachers in Kuje Area Council to proceed on an indefinite strike with effect from Tuesday, January 10 until further notice.
