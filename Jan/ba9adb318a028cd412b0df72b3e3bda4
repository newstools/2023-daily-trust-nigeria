The Sokoto State government has pulled down some campaign posters and billboards of political parties for violating the state’s environmental laws. The billboards include those of the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the main opposition, the All Progressives Congress (APC). Briefing newsmen yesterday, the Special Adviser to Governor Aminu Tambuwal in charge of the exercise, Sidi Lamido, said the operation became necessary in view of the gross violation of the agreement reached with political parties in the state. “Last year, precisely on the 25th of August, we had a meeting with all the political parties on the need to abide by our regulations. “We told them what they needed to do before posting their posters, as well as where not to erect their billboards. We all agreed to work together in the interest of the state. “But some of them violated the rules. They placed their posters and billboards in some restricted areas, while others placed them without our permission. “We removed all these posters and billboards, including those of the candidates of PDP. if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[250,250],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_3',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');“This is to show you that we are not partisan.
