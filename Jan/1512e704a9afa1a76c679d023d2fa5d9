The Director-General, Bureau of Public Service Reforms (BPSR), Dasuki Ibrahim Arabi, has said the introduction of some schemes, like the Treasury Single Account (TSA), has improved the efficiency of the civil service. Dasuki stated this in Abuja while speaking on the topic, ‘Agile HR Practices in Driving Performance in Public Service’, at the Human Capital Strategy Forum organised by Bratim Business School. He said, “In 2008, we said we hope to digitalise management of financial resources of government and we produced the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System  (IPPIS), Government Integrated Finance Information Management System (GIFMIS), Treasury Single Account (TSA) and BVN. “With IPPIS, we know the number of people that are on the payroll of the federal government and before the end of the month, we know how much is needed to pay salaries of public servants,” he said. Dasuki also disclosed that BPSR has developed an application to enable auditors to work online through an open portal. He further stated that it has also developed a civil service strategy to improve the skill and capacity of officers from point of recruitment, promotion and discipline. The acting Dean, BRATIM Business School, Mr Tejan Ibrahim, said there is a need for organisations in the public and private sectors to embrace the tenets of inclusivity to create balance and effectiveness to be able to achieve competence in the workplace.
