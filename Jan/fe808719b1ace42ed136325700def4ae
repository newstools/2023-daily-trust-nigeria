The Kaduna State All Progressives Congress (APC) Campaign Council has unveiled the manifesto of its governorship candidate, Senator Uba Sani, which contains a 7-point agenda, aimed at improving the lives of the citizens. A statement Sunday by the Director of Strategic Communication, Malam Ibraheem Musa, said the 7- point agenda has the acronym SUSTAIN, adding that it spans the entire spectrum of security and human capital development. He said the manifesto is a social contract between the party and the  people of Kaduna State. Part of the statement reads, ’In addition, the next  APC government will invest in human capital and nurture citizens’ engagement. This is what SUSTAIN stands for and the 7-point agenda will be the compass of  the APC administration.” Similarly, the Action Democratic Party (ADP) governorship candidate in Kaduna State, Alhaji Sani Sha’aban, has promised to restore religious tolerance if given the mandate. He urged the people of the state to vote for all the candidates of ADP, stressing that the party, if elected, would “restore the lost glory” of the state. The former House of Representatives member, who addressed newsmen in the state, expressed optimism that he would win the March 11 poll and address the “religious imbalance” in the state if elected. if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[250,250],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_3',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');Meanwhile, the governorship candidate of the APC in Niger State, Umar Mohammed Bago, has pledged to complete all the developmental projects initiated by the current governor across the state.
