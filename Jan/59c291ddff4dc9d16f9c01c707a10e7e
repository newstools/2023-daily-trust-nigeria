The Nigerian Association of Small Scale Industrialists (NASSI) has urged the federal government to build business clusters for the sector to thrive. Speaking at the 34th National Convention yesterday in Abuja, the National President of NASSI, Solomon Vongfa, said clusters are important to generate sales and help reduce the burden of rent on small industries. Vongfa stated that the lack of necessary infrastructures is impeding the growth of the sector together with the harsh business environment they need to work in. “The major challenge for small scale industries is lack of a suitable enabling environment because if you give me money and I can’t operate effectively, the economy is harsh, taxes are there and there have been increases on taxes with the new law, so it is going to be tight for entrepreneurs. He stressed that Infrastructure is key for them because the majority of members rent apartments to run their business,” he said. The Minister of State for Industry, Ambassador Mariam Yalwaji Katagum, said the ministry has been collaborating with the association to support the growth and development of small- scale industries. She noted that the sector’s use of the local resources to produce goods and services is adding values to products. if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[300,250],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_3',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');“This will in turn increase the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the country. Also, create employment opportunities, income for the people, create wealth, thereby accounting for an increase in the per capita income of Nigeria; in other words, an increase in the supply of goods and services.”
