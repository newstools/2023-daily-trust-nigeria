Dani Alves’ wife, Joana Sanz, has come out to support her husband following rape allegations that have seen him detained by Spanish police. The Spanish model tied the knot with Dani Alves in 2017, and according to an interview, she believes her husband did not commit the crime he is being accused of. Joana Sanz, the 29-year-old wife of Brazilian full-back Dani Alves, took to a televised interview to support her husband. “I know who my husband is,” she said in the interview, per Het Laatste Nieuws. “I know how respectful he is. I have often seen women dare to try something with him while standing next to him. I don’t want to know what they’re trying to do when I’m not there.” Sanz also used her Instagram to show solidarity with her lover, posting a picture of their hands locked together with the caption ‘together’. The former Barcelona full-back has denied the allegations levied against him. if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[580,400],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_3',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');He stated that he enjoys dancing alone and does not try to bother anyone, in an attempt to refute allegations that he danced with his accuser before entering the bathroom with her. The 39-year-old is currently in detention while Mossos d’Esquadra, the Catalan police, investigates. He is not allowed to post bail because the judge deems him a flight risk. Dani Alves has been fired by his club Pumas UNAM following his arrest.
