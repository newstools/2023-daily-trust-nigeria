The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on Wednesday issued operational guidelines for open banking in the country. The guidelines establish principles for data sharing across banking and payment systems. In a circular referenced PSM/DIR/PUB/CIR/001/043 and dated March 7, 2023, the apex bank said the guidelines would create greater access to customer-focused data sharing between banks and third-party firms. Open banking is the practice of enabling secure interoperability in the banking industry by allowing third-party payment services and other financial service providers to access banking transactions and other data from banks and financial institutions.
