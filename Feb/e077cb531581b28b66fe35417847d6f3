President Muhammadu Buhari met with Girma Wake, Ethiopian Airlines board chairman, during which they exchanged views on the operationalisation of Nigeria Air. The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, in a statement issued on Monday, said Wake had at the meeting on Sunday in Addis Ababa requested a resolution of the legal obstacle halting Nigeria Air, which Ethiopian Airlines has 49% stake, from commencing operations. He had also requested the repatriation of the airline funds trapped in the country over foreign exchange challenges. On Nigeria Air, President Buhari told the board chairman that it was a ‘weighty decision’ by the Nigerian government to re-launch a national carrier, expressing confidence that ‘‘things will be alright.’’ Buhari pledges support for int’l humanitarian organisations Deliverology: An agenda to make budget work in Nigeria Wake, who met with President Buhari on the margins of the 36th AU Summit, said the airline had been treated very well in Nigeria since it started operations 60 years ago in the country. ‘‘Nigeria is not just a market but a hub for aviation in Africa. Nigeria is a special country and nobody travels more around the globe than Nigerians,’’ he said. The aviation chief, who was accompanied on the visit by Mesfin Tasswe, Group Chief Executive Officer of Ethiopian Airlines, and Daniel Abebe, Group Vice President Strategic Planning and Alliances, hinted that the airline had plans to expand operations in the country, with additional daily flight services to Lagos from Addis Ababa, as well as Abuja-Addis Ababa. He said the airline and its partners are ready to commence operations on Nigeria Air as soon as all the court matters are resolved.
