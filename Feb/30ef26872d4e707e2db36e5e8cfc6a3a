Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar has boasted that his party will win the February 25 presidential election. Addressing party supporters and chieftains in Umuahia, the Abia State capital, on Saturday, Atiku charged supporters not to be distracted by other political parties as they are not going to win the election. National chairman of the party, Dr Iyorchia Ayu, in his remarks also called on the people of the South East not to vote for the Labour Party (LP) presidential candidate, Mr Peter Obi, saying a vote for him will only enhance the chances of the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate Bola Ahmed Tinubu. “PDP is going to win. Therefore, it is better that you are on a winning ticket than on a ticket that cannot take you anywhere. “I appeal to you not to be distracted by other political parties that may be playing either religious or ethnic card. In PDP, we have no religious or ethnic card, we play only Nigeria card. “A card that will bring everybody onboard, a card that will give a sense of belonging to every part of this country, to every religion, to every ethnicity,” he said.
