The FCT Division of the High Court has restrained Abuduljalil Balewa from claiming that the late first prime minister of Nigeria, Abubakar Tafawa Balewa was his father. Mukhtar, Saddik and Umar, children of the late prime minister, filed a suit before Justice Peter Kekemeke, claiming that Mr Abduljalil is not their brother. Delivering judgment in the suit marked FCT/HC/CV/956/2015, Mr Kekemeke held that the claimants had proved their case. He held that they had proven their case from the evidence the claimants placed before the court. The judge held that the defendant, Mr Abduljalil, did not prove his claims of the late prime minister’s paternity. “There is no evidence presented to show that the late prime minister was his father nor evidence of where he was born. No evidence to show that there was a marriage between his mother and the late premier. “It is my view that the claimants have proved their case from the evidence placed before the court,” stated the judge. “In the circumstance, the case succeeds, judgment is hereby entered in favour of the claimants against the defendant as follows: the defendant was never the son of the late prime minister Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa. “Order of perpetual injunction is placed on the defendant restraining himself, agents or servants from referring to himself as the son or grandson or blood relation of Sir Balewa.” The judge added, “In addition, a public apology and retraction of all previous claims by the defendant in the print and electronic media that he is the son or grandson of the late prime minister. Also, a sum of N250,000 as a cost for the claim should be paid by the defendant.” NAN
