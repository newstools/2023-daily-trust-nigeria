 The Rivers State chapter of the Ahmed Bola Tinubu Presidential Campaign Council (PCC) has said no one will sabotage its campaign and effort geared towards the emergence of the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, as president. The council said it had already mobilised about 50,000 persons across the 23 LGAS of the state to attend Tinubu’s presidential campaign rally billed to hold on February 15, 2023. The Chairman of the PCC Local Organising Committee (LCC) in Rivers, Chief Tony Okocha, told reporters shortly after inspecting the Yakubu Gowon Stadium, venue of the presidential rally, at the weekend that all was set for the rally. Chief Okocha further said that all APC members in Rivers were united in their drive to ensure a successful and hitch-free rally. He said, “Even though nothing has been advanced to us, we have taken the bull by the horns, and as a people we have felt that no attempt and nobody will attempt to sabotage what the APC is doing in Rivers State. “So, we have put resources together and we have also mobilised a minimum of 50,000 persons to attend the rally at this particular venue. We are here to ensure the success of the rally. We have put everything in place to ensure that we have a very successful rally come February 25.” Similarly, a pro-APC group, Asiwaju for Shettima Organisation, has said no force could stop Tinubu’s emergence as President Muhammadu Buhari’s successor. Leader of the group, Dr Adetunji Oredipe, spoke to newsmen in Abeokuta, Ogun State, against the backdrop of the Aso Rock “cabals” allegedly working against the APC candidate by using the naira and fuel crises to scuttle his chances at the poll. He said Tinubu/Shettima remains a formidable presidential ticket in the coming general elections, noting that, “No force can stop them.”
