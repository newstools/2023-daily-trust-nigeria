Portugal’s new manager, Roberto Martinez, has spoken on the team’s plans for the Al Nassr’s star, Cristiano Ronaldo. Martinez was confirmed as the new Portugal boss replacing Fernando Santos on Monday, following his sacking as Belgium manager immediately after the World Cup. Martinez has now opened up on Ronaldo, claiming he has yet to meet the players. He said, “Football decisions have to be taken on the pitch. I’m not a coach who makes decisions in an office. “My starting point is to meet them all today, to contact all the players. The list of 26 players from the last World Cup is my starting point, and Cristiano is a player on that list. “He has been in the national team for 19 years and he deserves the respect to sit down and talk. And tomorrow we will start talking and getting to know each other, and Cristiano is one of them. “I have a clear idea of the structure and the roles of the coaching staff. I will announce it in the next few days. I would like to bring in a Portuguese assistant, a former national team player. “He will be important for the coaching staff and will give us an acceleration for Portuguese football. I don’t believe in systems. I think you have to bring out the talent to win games.”
