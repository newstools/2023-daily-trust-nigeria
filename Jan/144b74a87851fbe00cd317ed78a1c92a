The Chairman of the FCT Universal Basic Education Board (FCT UBEB), Dr Alhassan Sule, has been honoured as the “Most Prudent State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) Chairman in the North Central”. Sule was honoured at the weekend in Abuja at the national finals of the 62nd Independence Anniversary of the President’s Inter- Basic (Primary) Schools Debate Championship organised by the President’s School Debate Nigeria in collaboration with the FCT UBEB. The award was presented to Sule by Dr Isiaka Kolawole, Deputy Executive Secretary, UBEC, at the auditorium of the Federal Ministry of Education in Abuja. Sule, while commending the organisers, stressed that being a victim of Boko Haram in the bush for four months, the solution was “at our fingertips; moulding the characters of children through the classroom.” He appreciated the Minister of State, FCT, Dr Ramatu Tijani Aliyu, for giving him the enabling environment to ensure that every child resident in the territory got access to qualitative free basic education. Earlier, the National Coordinator, President’s School Debate Nigeria, Dare Oritu, described debate as a tool for conflict resolution among groups in Nigeria.
