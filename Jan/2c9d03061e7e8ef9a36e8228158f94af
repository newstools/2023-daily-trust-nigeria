In preparation for the 2022/2023 Nation-Wide League One (NLO) season, billed to kick off in April, the organisers of the league have approved only five stadia in Lagos that have met the standards required for matches. The NLO Chief Operating Officer (COO), Mr Shola Ogunnowo, who disclosed this to our correspondent in Lagos, regretted that most of the stadiums in Lagos were undergoing renovation and won’t be ready in time for the new season. He said “Most of the state government-owned stadiums in Lagos are majorly under renovation. Onikan stadium, Teslim Balogun stadium, National stadium, Agege stadium and Igbogbo stadium are not ready for use. “So, none of these facilities is available for us to use this year and it is difficult for us to send teams away.” He listed Legacy pitch, NIS stadium, Abati barracks new stadium, Navy town stadium and strong tower stadium as the approved stadia ready for use by over 45 clubs both at division 1 and 2 levels. Ogunnowo also said the league organisers have approached the owners of the approved stadia to let their facilities at an affordable cost to the clubs. “In as much as we don’t have many facilities around these communities that they can use, we try to ensure the good ones that are available are being utilized.
