It also said it impounded a bullion van and about 701 means of conveyance of the smuggled items from those it referred to as economic saboteurs. It said the Duty Paid Value (DPV) of the contraband totaling about 258,385 is worth N6.2billion andÂ  formed the bulk of goods which was intercepted between August 2019 and January 2023. Compt.

He revealed that over 10 suspects have been arrested in connection with the seizures, but have been granted administrative bail, adding that the collaboration with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has also yielded one conviction with others at various levels of legal processes which will be heading for the court.
