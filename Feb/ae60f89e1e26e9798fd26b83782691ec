Ogun State governor, Dapo Abiodun, on Thursday said the state government has taken delivery of drones to assist the security agencies to track criminals. The governor stated this when he received the new Commissioner of Police in the state, Frank Mba, and the new Brigade Commander of the 35 Artillery Brigade, Alamala, Abeokuta, Brigadier-General Mohammed Aminu, in his office on Thursday. Abiodun noted that Ogun in conjunction with Oyo State had established different security points along the Lagos-Ibadan expressway to curb kidnapping and other criminal activities. He also disclosed that the police commands of the two neighbouring states have been largely responsible for the constant combing of the forest being used by criminals on the axis. &#8216;Killers&#8217; of Ogun couple, son murdered on New Year day arrested Police arrest woman for selling PVCs in Enugu “We have since ordered some drones that have now arrived.
