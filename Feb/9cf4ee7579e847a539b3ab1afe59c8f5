The Greater Nigeria Professionals (GNP) has lauded Mele Kyari, the Group Chief Executive Officer, Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPCL), for the efforts to sustain petrol supply amidst global energy crisis. The chairman of GNP, Ahmed Tahir, in a statement said: “Because of a poor understanding of what is going on; or for sheer mischief, Nigerians look for and find a scapegoat in the NNPC Ltd and its leadership under Mele Kyari. If only they know the dynamics that combine to produce these fuel queues, they will be saluting Mr Kyari and the NNPC under his leadership, instead of maligning him. “Kyari works 24/7 to make sure that despite daunting challenges, PMS or petrol is available in Nigeria daily,” the group said. GNP however blamed saboteurs for excess profiteering leading to the hike in the price of petrol to the detriment of Nigerians. The group also commended Kyari for being honoured with the ‘The Sun Man of The Year Award 2022’ for the second consecutive time which the members said is “well-deserved.” “Kyari has successfully renegotiated the Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano (AKK) Gas Pipeline contract. He played an important role in facilitating the passage of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021,” it added.
