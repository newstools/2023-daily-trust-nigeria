The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, yesterday described the naira redesign policy and fuel scarcity at the twilight of the general elections as a plot to rig tomorrow’s polls. Gbajabiamila stated this in Lagos during his constituency outreach programme where he distributed several items, including 161 cars and 555 laptops. He stressed that the biting economic situation in the country was a premeditated action to dissuade voters from voting the APC presidential candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, saying the crisis caused by the policy was tantamount to election rigging. He said, “What has happened in Nigeria in the past three weeks, no cash; that is nothing but rigging the elections. It is done for a purpose and the only purpose is to make sure that the man Nigerians love does not win the election. “But you know why I am happy, I take solace from one thing that God is a wonderful God, that with all their permutations, I see God’s hand in this project.”
