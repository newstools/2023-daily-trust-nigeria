He said this on Saturday in a statement, urging Nigerians to be vigilant as the virus makes a comeback. According to him, he was isolating and had cancelled all public events till he received a negative report. He urged Nigerians not to take the COVID-19 for granted, saying infection rates had risen rapidly all over the world in the last few weeks. 199 of 280 doctors on Zamfara payroll are ghost workers &#8211; Matawalle Jonathan: We get so blinded when we get political power “Nigerians must not let their guard down even though the government has relaxed COVID rules. Our public health system can’t cope with the fallout of huge infection rates with attendant symptoms especially at a time when our health care professionals are leaving the country in droves. “We must increase testing and take all necessary precautions not to spread the virus. We must not allow political rallies to become COVID spreaders and reverse the gains made in combating the virus. We will survive the Corona Virus if we all remain vigilant,” Kachikwu said.
