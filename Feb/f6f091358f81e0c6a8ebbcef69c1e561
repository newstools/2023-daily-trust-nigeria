The Bayelsa State Police Command has beefed up security in banks and Automated Teller Machine (ATM) points in the state due to the scarcity of the new naira notes. Consequently, the Commissioner of Police in the state, Mr Ben Nebolisa Okolo, has charged Divisional Police Officers, Tactical Commanders and other operatives to closely monitor banks and ATM points to forestall any breach of the peace. Police spokesman in Bayelsa State, SP Asinim Butswat, told newsmen in a statement on Sunday that the command understood the plights of the masses and were hopeful that the new measures introduced by the CBN would improve the circulation of the currency in the coming days. According to him, miscreants, under any guise, are hereby warned to desist from carrying out any unlawful assembly to unleash violence in the state, as the command will not allow any person or group of persons to truncate the relative peace being enjoyed. He appealed to members of the public to remain calm and go about their lawful and legitimate businesses as the command is poised to guarantee public safety and security.
