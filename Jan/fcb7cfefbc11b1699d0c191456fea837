The presidential candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Prince Adewole Adebayo, has said he is happy that he is not considered among the top and leading candidates for the presidential election because that would have made him a part of the wanted list. Speaking to journalists in Kano, on Tuesday, as part of activities before the party’s campaign rally in the state, Adebayo said the ‘wanted list’ is the list of those parties that have ruled or are ruling the country and have “offended Nigerians.” He said the message he is passing to Nigerians is that the solution to the problems confronting the nation lies in the hands of the electorate, and it would be fatal to adopt a rinse-and-repeat approach with politicians and political parties that have contributed to the sorry state of the country.
