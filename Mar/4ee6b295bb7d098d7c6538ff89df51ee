The Road Transport Employers Association of Nigeria (RTEAN) has warned its members against violence ahead of Saturday’s governorship and House of Assembly elections in Ogun State. The union also endorsed Governor Dapo Abiodun’s re-election bid, saying it’s payback time for the governor’s good deeds. The state’s Chairman of RTEAN, Akibu Titilayo (Efele), disclosed this while addressing newsmen. He said, “Governor Abiodun has done well on road reconstruction across the state. Good roads are what we value as transporters because they allow our vehicles to always be in good shape.
