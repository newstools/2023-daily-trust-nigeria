The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Osun State has accused the Commissioner of Police (CP) in the state, Kehinde Longe, of bias and called for his transfer from the state. The party alleged that the CP was not neutral and that he allegedly refused to act on reports of attacks on APC members in the state. Addressing a press conference in Osogbo yesterday, the party’s spokesman, Kola Olabisi, called on the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Alkali Baba Usman, to transfer Longe from the state. Similarly, the spokesperson of the Tinubu/Shettima Presidential Campaign Council (PCC) in Osun, Oluremi Omowaye, and the Chief Press Secretary to the immediate past governor of the state, Adegboyega Oyetola, Ismail Omipidan, said the APC in Osun had lost confidence in the CP. But the state Chairman of PDP, Adekunle Akindele, said that the CP was not biased in favour of the PDP as claimed by the APC. Akindele also debunked the insinuation that APC members were attacked by PDP members, saying that APC members were the ones attacking PDP members in the state. Meanwhile, the CP Longe said he was carrying out his duties professionally and that the cases of attacks by political parties were under investigation. Speaking through the command’s spokesman, Yemisi Opalola, the CP assured that all cases would be investigated and culprits brought to book.
