The Supreme Court has ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to conduct a fresh delineation of electoral wards and units in Delta State. A five-member panel had in a December judgement obtained by our reporter at the weekend, ordered the fresh delineation of electoral wards and units in Warri South West, Warri South and Warri North LGAs of Delta State. In the lead judgment delivered by Justice Uwani Musa Abba-Aji, the apex court held that it relied on Section 22 of the Supreme Court Act to direct the fresh delineation before the 2023 general elections. The court made the compelling order while delivering judgment in an appeal filed by Hon. George Timinimi and nine others against INEC in the appeal marked SC/413/2016. The appeal followed the judgement of the Federal High Court, Asaba on March 28, 2011 dismissing the suit brought by Timinimi against INEC for themselves and on behalf of the Ijaws of Warri Federal Constituency of Delta State. The dismissal was upheld by the Court of Appeal in Benin, which forced Taminimiâ€™s counsel, Eric Omare Esq, to approach the Supreme Court.
