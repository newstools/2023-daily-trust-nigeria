Governor Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State has refuted claims in some quarters that 11 of the 22 governors who are members of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) were having secret meetings with the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar. He spoke yesterday during a meeting with party officials, members of his campaign council, as well as elected and appointed government officials at the government house Lafia, the state capital. There are hints that some governors and National Working Committee (NWC) members of the APC were working for Atiku instead of the ruling party’s candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, ahead of the February 25 poll. He said the claim was untrue and the handiwork of the opposition and those looking for favour from Tinubu and bent on painting the APC governors black. Governor Sule said there was no reason for any APC governor from the North to want to meet with Atiku, particularly considering that it was the same Northern APC governors that stood firm for the party’s presidential ticket to go to the South. He said nobody was presently under pressure to ensure that Tinubu won the presidential election more than the APC northern governors. He used the occasion to call on the presidential candidate of the APC, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, to be wary of such falsehoods and those circulating it. if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[250,250],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_3',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[250,250],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_4',151,'0','1'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0_1'); .box-4-multi-151{border:none !important;display:block !important;float:none !important;line-height:0px;margin-bottom:15px !important;margin-left:auto !important;margin-right:auto !important;margin-top:15px !important;max-width:100% !important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px;padding:0;text-align:center !important;}He said, “When the APC governors from the North realised that we were trying to retain the position in the North, the APC governors rose to the occasion and said no, this position has to go to the South in order for us to be respected as people who believe in Nigeria. “After Baba held this office for eight years, with the help of the South, if today we say we still want to hold on to the position, the world will not respect Northerners.”
