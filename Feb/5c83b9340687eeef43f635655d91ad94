The Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Ahmed Idris Wase, has denied recruiting vigilantes to harass voters and disrupt tomorrow’s elections in Wase LGA of Plateau State. The state’s spokesman of the PDP, John T. Akans, had alleged that Wase was recruiting vigilantes from neighbouring states to disrupt the elections. But reacting in a statement by his spokesman, Umar Puma, yesterday, Wase described the allegation as false. Part of the statement reads: “We wish to state without equivocation that this is absolute falsehood and there is no iota of truth in these allegations as they only exist within the absurd imagination of the chairman, his party and followers. “The deputy speaker is not known for any acts of violence and has won elections four times to represent the constituency and has no cause whatsoever to ‘import’ vigilantes to come and harass his people who have absolute confidence and trust in him. “We challenge the PDP in the state and their co-travellers to disclose the identities of the vigilantes. We also urge the Commissioner of Police to interrogate the PDP chairman and his group to disclose the identity of those being recruited, where they were recruited and who and how they were recruited.”
