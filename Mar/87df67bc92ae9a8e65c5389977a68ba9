The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has denied delisting Ladi Adebutu’s name as governorship candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), ahead of Saturday’s election in Ogun State. There are reports on social media that the PDP has no governorship candidate in the election. Some members of the opposition All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state have been circulating the news that INEC has not recognised Adebutu as candidate of the party. But the Residence Electoral Commissioner (REC) of INEC in Ogun State, Niyi Ijalaye, has dispelled the rumour, describing it as unfounded. Ijalaye who spoke with newsmen yesterday in Abeokuta said, “It is a rumour that is not founded, that is all.” The REC insisted that Adebutu remained the governorship candidate of the PDP in the state and called on residents of the state to ignore the baseless claim.
