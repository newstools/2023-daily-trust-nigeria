A former President of the Association of Psychiatrists of Nigeria (APN), Prof Taiwo Sheikh, has advised Nigerians to embrace happiness in order to enhance their optimal mental wellbeing. Sheikh, of the Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital (ABUTH), Zaria, gave the advice on Tuesday in Lagos, urging people to always share their thoughts with positive-minded people in order to boost their happiness and mental health. The medical expert said that engaging in positive activities that gave happiness while avoiding anger would help in promoting optimal mental wellbeing and prevent depression. He noted that said there was a connection between happiness and mental wellbeing, saying anger produced “a physiological crash”, hence that the angrier one got, the more depressed one would become. Sheikh explained that,” Anger elevates blood pressure, increases the threat of stroke, heart disease, cancer, depression, anxiety and generally depresses the immune system. “So, constantly surrounding yourself with positive people will help manage stress/depression. Buying expensive clothes or jewellery will not bring permanent happiness. “If one is in a happy state, it means less trouble, stress and better wellbeing. If one is unhappy, there will be depression, suicidal thoughts, anxiety and stress disorder.” While noting that depression was a significant problem that affected some youths and made them become drug addicts, he said, “Drug addiction is being experienced due to poor state of mental health and seeking temporary pleasure and satisfaction.” He added that, “We need to create time for relaxation and look beyond the economic situation of the country. We should also be positive in every bad situation.” (NAN)
