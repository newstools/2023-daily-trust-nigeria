Ahead of the 2023 general elections, the Nigerian Navy has pledged to support the Independent National Electoral Commission in providing security and support in the movement of electoral materials to coastal communities in Rivers State. The Commanding Officer of NNS Pathfinder, Navy Captain Stanley Umeh, who spoke with our reporter on the sidelines of the 2023 first quarter route march of the navy in Port Harcourt, said the march was a sign of readiness of navy personnel ahead of the elections. He said the march was a show of force against criminal elements, vandals, oil thieves, and also to build confidence in the populace that the navy and the armed forces were on ground to protect lives and property. He said, “Route march is a sign of readiness for us. Route march is a routine exercise in the military. This is the first quarter route march for 2023, and it is done across all naval formations across the country. “It’s also part of the Chief of Naval Staff’s strategic imperative that the Nigerian Navy supports INEC in every way possible in reaching out to the creeks and ensure election materials get to the coastal communities safely and that elections are conducted there without rancor.”
