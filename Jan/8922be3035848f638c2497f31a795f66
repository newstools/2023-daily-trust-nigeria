Gunmen have shot dead a truck driver simply identified as Halidu, injured three others and abducted six by a bush in Rudu village in Toto LGA of Nasarawa State. A relative of the abducted victims, Saidu Adamu, said the incident happened on Monday, when the gunmen opened fire on a truck carrying timber at a forest in Rudu village. He said the gunmen emerged from the bush, opened fire on the moving truck and the bullet hit the driver. “When their bullets hit the driver, he was forced to stop while three other labourers sitting on the timber escaped with bullet wounds,” he said.

According to him, the gunmen whisked away six people at gunpoint, saying the three injured were receiving treatment at an undisclosed hospital in Toto town.
