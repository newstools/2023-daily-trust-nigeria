The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, has said that federal lawmakers must continue to perform their statutory functions despite the distractions of political campaigns. He stated this in his address at the resumption of the house’s plenary on Tuesday. He, however, assured that the 9th National Assembly will pass all pending bills before it before the legislative year elapses in June this year. He said there are several bills that are still undergoing legislative process which need to be passed. He said the bills, when passed and assented to, would have significant impacts on different sectors of Nigeria’s socio-economic spheres. Gbajabiamila said, “It is imperative that the house focuses its efforts on completing the tasks it has already initiated and closing out the assignments on which the legacy of the 9th house will be assessed. “We must resolve to continue to do the people’s work despite the obligations and distractions of the political campaign season. “As we approach the end of our term in office, I am hopeful that we will continue to meet and exceed expectations in this New Year.”
