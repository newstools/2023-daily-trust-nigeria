Ogun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, has announced a minimum of 60 percent concession to all religious and worship centers applying for building plans in the state. Abiodun, who made this known in Abeokuta during an engagement with the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), noted that his administration had decided that religious centers applying for approval to build their worship centers would no longer have to pay for such approvals like business concerns. “On the approvals being given to our churches to build worship centers, those approvals are given as if they are being given to businesses, I have affirmed that from today, that will not happen anymore. “I will give a concession for approvals to all worship centers, every application that I receive now will be given a minimum of 60 percent discount,” he said.
