People Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar has said that he is in touch with the presidential candidate of New Nigerian People Party (NNPP) Rabi’u Musa Kwankwaso for possible support. In an interview with BBC Hausa service, Atiku said he is also holding talks with the Labour Party (LP) Presidential Candidate, Peter Obi.

We are in talk with them, one of them may possibly come,” he said.
