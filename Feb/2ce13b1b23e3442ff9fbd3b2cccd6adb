Many persons are currently trapped in a two-storey building that collapsed at 4th Avenue, Gwarinmpa, Abuja on Thursday morning. Details of the incident are sketchy at the time of this report but sources said some dead bodies have been recovered. Mrs Florence Wenegieme, Director, Forecasting, Response and Mitigation, FCT Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), confirmed the incident to Daily Trust, saying her team had rescued 11 persons. “The persons we rescued have been taken to Gwarimpa General Hospital. We are working to rescue more victims,” she said. In August last year, a two-storey building collapsed in Kubwa, a satellite town in Bwari Area Council of the territory, killing one person and leaving workers trapped. The building, which was under construction, collapsed at Hamza Abdullahi Street, off Gado Nasco Road.
