The Kwara Sector Command of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has impounded 37 vehicles during Saturday’s Presidential/National Assembly election in Kwara. The Sector Commandant, Mr Frederick Ogidan, disclosed this on Wednesday in Ilorin. Ogidan said the 37 vehicles impounded violated the restriction order of the Election Day and were released to the owners immediately after the election. “People complied very well in Kwara, except few ones that violated the restriction order. I commend the manner in which motorists conducted themselves. “We hope they can still maintain that spirit on March 11. They made our work easy in Kwara for obeying instructions,” he said.
