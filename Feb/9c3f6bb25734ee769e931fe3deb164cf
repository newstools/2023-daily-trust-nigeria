Marvin Achi, one of the recently-evicted housemates of the Big Brother Titans, on Thursday, said he would have stayed longer in the show if he had understood that the entire show was a game. Marvin, the Chemical Engineer from Rivers state, during a zoom interview with journalists, said he had no knowledge of the fact that the show was a game. “I would have stayed longer on the show if I had understood that the show was a real game,” he said. The 25-year-old noted that he would be looking forward to returning to his already established health and fitness business as he also planned to open gymnastics centres around Nigeria and South Africa. He said he was also planning to embrace modeling. “I have a health and fitness business before going into the house, this is all about sales of supplements for weight loss and muscle building. “I have plans to establish gymnastics centres in Nigeria and South Africa, also to work on modeling,” he said.
