The presidential candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, has advised Nigerians to vote the party at all levels in this year’s general elections for good governance in the country. Kwankwaso made the call during the party’s North East zonal rally held yesterday in Bauchi. He said there was the need for Nigerians to vote out the APC and PDP because “They have failed the country in terms of security, in terms of economy, in terms of infrastructure and of course,  in terms of unity among Nigerians.” Kwankwaso boasted that NNPP was the only answer to the avalanche of challenges bedevilling the country. He said, “Let me use this opportunity to tell the people of North East and Nigeria as a whole, that our party, the NNPP, has come of age now; we are in all the wards of this country.” He urged party supporters to work for its successful outing ahead of the February and March general elections.
