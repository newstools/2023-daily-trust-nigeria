The All Progressives Congress (APC) Presidential Campaign Council has asked the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to make public the total number of PVCs collected across the country ahead of this Saturday’s presidential and National Assembly elections. The Director Election Planning and Monitoring of the APC Presidential Campaign Council and Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Raji Fasola, made the request at a press conference on Tuesday in Abuja. He said INEC should give a breakdown of PVCs collected by registrants in each state and local government area of the country. He said, “We are prepared. We have trained agents. We are in the homestretch of the election and we think it is important now that INEC, the regulator, let us, all the parties and the nation, know how many people actually collected Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs).

We have been acquainted with how many people were registered, but we don’t have the number of how many people who collected PVCs and that is very important to ask. “And I think I speak the minds of all the parties; how many people collected PVCs, the breakdown of the PVCs collection per state and per local government and to every unit of electoral activity that INEC can provide that information. “We think it is a very important piece of information that will help INEC reinforce the credibility of the exercise that it is undertaking. Other than that, we are busy doing what we do best – preparing, planning.”
