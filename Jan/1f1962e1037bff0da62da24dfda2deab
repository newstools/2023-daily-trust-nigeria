The West Africa Democracy Solidarity Network (WADEMOS) and the Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD) have urged the federal government to address the lingering fuel scarcity and tackle insecurity to ensure the success of this year’s general elections. The WADEMOS delegation made the call yesterday in Abuja at the end of its “Solidarity Mission to Nigeria” ahead of the elections. The Director of Advocacy and Policy Engagement, Ghana Centre for Democratic Development (CDD-Ghana), Mr Kojo Asante, who spoke on behalf of the WADEMOS team, said the mission was due to the shared democratic values by people across the ECOWAS sub-region. He said their call became imperative in order for the federal government to improve the availability of fuel to mitigate the effects the current shortage could have on the smooth conduct of the elections. He noted that it was capable of increasing voter apathy, particularly for voters who would travel long distances to their polling stations, and that it also had implications for the movement of security personnel and patrol teams that would be deployed to provide security for the elections. He said, “Major concerns were raised on the collection and issuance of PVCs. Also, any large-scale malfunctioning of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) on Election Day could cause anxiety and panic among voters. “Another issue of concern is around the deployment of materials and logistics ahead of the elections. This fear is exacerbated by the current long-running incidence of fuel scarcity in the country. We strongly note the postponement of previous elections in Nigeria, partly due to logistical concerns.”
