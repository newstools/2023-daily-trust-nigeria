The Minister of the FCT and Special Envoy of  President Muhammadu Buhari to the Republic of Turkiye, Malam Muhammad Musa Bello, on February 23,  2023, delivered the president’s condolence message following the February 6 earthquake that hit the country. Bello was received by Türkiye’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, in Ankara, with the Nigerian Ambassador to Türkiye, Malam Ismail Abba Yusuf, in attendance. Bello noted that President Buhari was unable to personally pay the condolence visit due to the scheduled general elections in Nigeria. He conveyed the president’s condolences on behalf of the government and people of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to the government and people of Türkiye over the devastating earthquake. Bell also handed over Mr President’s letter of condolence, as well as a Central Bank of Nigeria Promissory Note of $1,000,000 for onward transmission to President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. He noted that the token was a donation by the Government of Nigeria to support the ongoing humanitarian effort in cushioning the effects of the tragic earthquake. In his remarks, Ambassador Çavuşoğlu explained that President Erdoğan was unable to personally receive the special envoy due to exigencies of directly overseeing humanitarian efforts in the 11 quake-hit Southern provinces of the country. He thanked President Buhari and the government and people of Nigeria for their show of solidarity, financial as well as material support to the Republic of Türkiye in its trying times. He noted that the First Lady of Nigeria, Hajiya Aisha Muhammadu Buhari, earlier donated 10,000 blankets on behalf of the African First Ladies Forum to the ongoing humanitarian effort in the country.
