An All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain and former National Organising Secretary of the party, Professor Ussiju Medaner, has said President Muhammadu Buhari’s decision to visit only 10 states to campaign for the APC presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, is to consolidate on the party’s strengths. Since the ruling APC embarked on its campaign around the country, many have questioned the absence of President Buhari from the rallies. However, the APC presidential campaign council recently announced that Buhari would attend the campaign in only 10 states. In a reaction, the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said the President’s decision to join Tinubu’s campaign in just 10 states was not surprising, adding that it was a confirmation that Buhari had been foot-dragging to support Tinubu. Speaking with Arise TV on the development, Medaner said Buhari’s decision to campaign in 10 states was to look at what had been done in those states and what was left to be done. He said: “You know the president has given a directive to the Federal Executive Council members, that’s the ministers, about the campaign. If you look at it, I think it’s a strategy to make the campaign take shape. Right now, the campaign has taken shape and governance has not suffered. “And adding value to the campaign, when you talk about that, you should remember the president right from 2003 to 2016 and 2019, actually has that value and has his supporters intact. So it’s just to consolidate what has been gained. “If you look at it horizontally and vertically, the campaign now is taking shape and it has gone very far. If you take the 10 states that he has chosen to go, you know in politics you have to look at the numbers, you have to look at your strengths, you have to look at where to augment. “So I think the president choosing those states is to go and loom at them, look at what has been done in those states and look at what should be done to the people.”
