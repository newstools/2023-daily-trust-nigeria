The Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) has confirmed Saturday March 18 as the new date for the postponed National Cross Country race. Tafida Gadzama, AFN’s first Vice-president who also heads the Road Race sub-committee confirmed that the race earlier scheduled to hold last month will now hold on March 18 with Jalingo, the capital of Taraba state still the venue. “The AFN National Cross Country race will hold on Saturday March 18 in Jalingo and the AFN is making arrangements for a hitch-free event,” said Gadzama, an Olympic gold medal winner in 2000. He said the journey to start producing world class middle and long distance runners begins with the athletes and the coaches who must know that they need to include cross country training in their training regime. “If they are competitive, achieve the standards that will get them to run in continental and international road races, they can start making money that they will use to take care of their families and contribute to the GDP of Nigeria,’ added Gadzama. The AFN vice-president says cross country running will make Nigerian athletes better and stronger runners. “According to experts, running cross- country does not only builds athletes’ physical strength but also their mental strength. “Anyone who has ever run cross-country understands the mental toughness that is necessary to complete a work-out and a race,” he maintained.
