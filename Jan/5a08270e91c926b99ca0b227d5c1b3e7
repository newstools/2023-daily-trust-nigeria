Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal of Sokoto State has cautioned political actors in the state against violence ahead of the forthcoming general elections and vowed to bring to book the attackers of his motorcade on Sunday. Suspected thugs had attacked the governor’s convoy with a hail of stones in the state capital, Sokoto, when he was returning with his entourage and party officials from a campaign tour in Silame and Wammako LGAs of the state. Also with the governor at the time were the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidates of Sokoto and Kebbi states, Mallam Saidu Umar (Mallam Ubandoman Sokoto) and Gen. Aminu Bande (rtd); the deputy governorship candidate of Sokoto State, Hon. Sagir Bafarawa and other dignitaries all of whom escaped unhurt. Two vehicles in the convoy were damaged by the attackers. But Tambuwal told newsmen at the close of a stakeholders’ meeting with political appointees on Monday that some of the attackers had been arrested and will soon be prosecuted. “The matter is being investigated by the security agencies. Some arrests have been made. Rest assured that the law will take its course. “We cannot condone any culture of violence in Sokoto State. I, therefore, urge all political leaders in Sokoto to eschew violence and to advise all their followers and supporters, to go out and campaign peacefully and look for votes, and not perpetrate violence. if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[336,280],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_4',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');“As you know, we believe in peace.
