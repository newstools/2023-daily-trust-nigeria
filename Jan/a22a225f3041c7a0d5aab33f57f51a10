There was panic Saturday when a passenger train plying the Warri-Itakpe route derailed leaving many passengers stranded. It was gathered that the train derailed in a forest in Kogi State forcing many passengers to abandon the train for fear of attacks. The derailment happened a few weeks after some passengers were kidnapped at the train station in Edo State. The incident has forced the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) to suspend the route pending when the track would be repaired even as the 148 passengers on board as well as the 30 crew members escaped unhurt. The Coordinator of Warri Itakpe Train Service, Engr. Sanni Abdulganiyu in a statement said: “The Warri Itakpe Train Service WITS 01 derailed at km 30 Ajaokuta-Itakpe section of the track at about 12:30hrs of Sunday 22nd January 2023. “Thankfully, there was no fatality and no casualty.
