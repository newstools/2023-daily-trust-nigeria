The National Directorate of Employment (NDE) has trained and empowered 26 youths with starter packs and over N2.7 million cash for self reliance in Adamawa. Presenting empowerment packages in Yola on Tuesday, Mrs Roseline Olawomi, the Head, Special Public Works Department, NDE Abuja, charged the beneficiaries to take advantage of the support on their lives. Olawomi, represented by Mrs Afiniki Alabi, said that the Federal Government was committed on empowering citizens aimed at reducing unemployment in the country. She advised them not to sale the kits or keep them, hence the need to start working with and be employers of labour as well as to mentor others. (NAN)
