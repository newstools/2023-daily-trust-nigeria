Former Masters champion Adam Scott has been elected by his peers to serve as chairman of the Player Advisory Council (PAC), the PGA Tour said on Tuesday. Scott beat out Maverick McNealy and Kevin Streelman in the vote to serve as chairman of the PAC, which advises and consults with the Policy Board and PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan on issues affecting the US-based circuit. The 42-year-old Australian will serve as PAC Chairman for the rest of 2023 and also replace Charley Hoffman as one of the player directors on the PGA Tour Policy Board on January 1, 2024, serving a three-year term.
