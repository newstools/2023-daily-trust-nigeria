The apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo General Assembly Worldwide, has said the Labour Party (LP) presidential candidate, Peter Obi, is not destined to win the February 25  presidential election. In a congratulatory statement to the President-elect, Bola Ahmed Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress (APC) yesterday,  the Director-General, Implementation and Strategic Planning, Ohanaeze Ndigbo General Assembly Worldwide, Ambassador Tony said Obi can fulfill his presidential ambition later but not in 2023. “Tinubu is capable, and we have no doubt in his capacity to ensure the continuity of the achievements of President Muhammadu Buhari, which are apparent, indisputably correct and will continue to stand as good legacies for generations of leaders to come. “This Igbo umbrella body will continue to remember Obi, former governor of Anambra State, as one who, despite all odds, laboured hard to actualise a Nigerian president from the Igboland. However, God has not destined it to happen in 2023. It may happen later. God spares the life of everybody. “It is more to show that the Igbo do not really hate themselves as some Nigerians tend to say. In all, general performances of the candidates across parties have given this group the confidence to agree that the emergence of one of them, who is Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress (APC), as President-elect of the Federal Republic of Nigeria is well deserved and we say congratulations,” he said.
