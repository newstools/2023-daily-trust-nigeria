The whereabouts of the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele, have been on the minds of many Nigerians. The absence of the Governor of the apex bank, came to light in December when he failed to show up to explain the reason behind the naira redesign and cash withdrawal limits. He was then said to be on leave until it was speculated that he may be on the run.  Emefiele is rumoured to be wanted by the Department of State Services (DSS) for alleged terrorism funding and economic crimes. People have speculated that his absence in the country is linked to his supposed evasion from the DSS, while some believe he is back in Nigeria. Whichever narrative one decides to believe, one sure thing is Emefiele, like the new naira notes, are proving tough to see. The CBN governorâ€™s whereabouts agitate the minds, the same way new naira notes are still largely missing in circulation. Meanwhile, another train attack rocked the country in Edo. About 31 persons are reported to be missing, while armed forces are working hard to rescue as many as possible.  What does this mean for Nigerians? Can they trust the governmmeht to keep them safe while using public transport or in public spaces? While on the matter of security, INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmud Yakubu, assured that the elections would hold despite security fears. While Atiku is back in the country, Tinubu is touring the North, Kwankwaso is promising that Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) will last for 4 years and Obi is reassuring Nigerians of his capability.  Campaigns are in full swing, and mammoth crowds are gathering for their respective candidates. Binani of Adamawa seems to be gathering a lot of support. Could this be Nigerians shot at having a first female governor?  Do you think Nigerians are ready for a female Governor? The next couple of weeks will provide the answer.
