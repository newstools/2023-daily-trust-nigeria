President Muhammadu Buhari has condemned what he called the “horrific attack” on vigilantes at Yargoje forest in Jibia Local Government Area of Katsina State, where many lives were lost. The bandits had ambushed a convoy of vigilantes in the forest as they went to recover stolen cows leading to the killings. The President, in a statement issued Sunday by his spokesman, Malam Garba Shehu, paid tribute to all those vigilantes and family members who had been martyred on Sunday. President Buhari said the sacrifices of the “brave men” who were re-working to prevent and punish crimes in their communities would not be forgotten. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the bereaved families in this difficult period. May Allah repose the soul of the deceased,” the President prayed.
