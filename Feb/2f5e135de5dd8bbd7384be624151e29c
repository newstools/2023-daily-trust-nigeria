Coach Kabiru Suleiman Dogo, who recently resigned as Technical Adviser of Wikki Tourists, has been appointed to head the technical crew of another struggling NPFL side, Kwara United. The former Nasarawa United and Lobi Stars coach has replaced Coach Abdulazeez Mohammed who resigned from the position on Saturday after the 0-2 loss to Nasarawa United. While making the announcement, the Chairman of Kwara United, Kumbi Titiloye, said it was necessary to name another coach as he maintained that leaving the vacuum created by the exit of Abdulazez won’t augur well for the club. Under Coach Abdulazeez, Kwara United won just a match which was the win against Akwa United FC, drew two against Gombe United and 3SC and lost the other four matches. Coach Abdulazeez was engaged on an interim basis with 12 matches to the end the 2021/2022 NPFL season, following the relocation of Coach Usman Abdullahi Biffo to the USA. Kwara United then unveiled him as the substantive Technical Adviser after the 2021/2022 season. Abdulazeez who hails from Kogi State arrived on the Nigerian coaching scene in 2020 with Katsina United. It will be recalled that his successor in Kwara United, Dogo also had a season to forget with Wikki Tourists as he couldn’t win a single match in the ongoing season before his resignation.
