Senator Shehu Sani has mocked the Governor Nyesom Wike-led G-5, saying they could not help themselves in elections, not to talk of their party’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar. The G-5 comprises five governors, Okezie Ikpeazu (Abia), Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi (Enugu), Samuel Ortom (Benue), Seyi Makinde (Oyo), and Wike. The G-5 had pulled out of the campaign of Atiku, demanding the resignation of the PDP National Chairman, Dr Iyorchia Ayu, as a condition for peace to reign.

The loyalists of Makinde, who is running for his second term, lost all the three senatorial districts to the APC in February 25 elections. Commenting on this via his Twitter handle Shehu Sani said even if Atiku got support from the G-5, it would not have changed anything. “Even if the G5 backed HE Atiku,it wouldn’t have made any difference.They couldn’t even help themselves talk less of helping their Presidential candidate.They failed to realise that the masses have gone beyond taking commanding instruction from Governors; Governors now beg,” he said.
