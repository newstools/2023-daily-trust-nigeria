The Chief Missioner of Nasrul-Lahi-l-Fatih Society (NASFAT), Imam Abdul-Azeez Onike has advised Nigerian politicians to play the political game by the rules and put the interest of the populace at heart.  He stated this in his New Year message to Nigerians, saying, “As we move into the election year, our politicians should not make their political ambition a do-or-die affair, knowing fully well that what has been destined for every individual will not miss him.” He made reference to a saying of the Noble Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) that “Everything has a reality, and the servant will not reach the reality of faith until he knows that what afflicted him could never miss him and that what missed him could never have afflicted him.” Onike however stated that his message should not be seen as giving a spiritual or religious value to the new Gregorian year, saying the Islamic faith has no special attachment to the year apart from the fact that the sun and moon are two means of knowing the number of years, as referenced in the Holy Qur’an. He prayed to Allah to continue to make peace reign supreme in Nigeria.
