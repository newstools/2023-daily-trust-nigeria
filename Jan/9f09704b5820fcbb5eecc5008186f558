Cristiano Ronaldo described himself as a “unique player” and insisted his career was not over as he arrived at his new club Al Nassr in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. The Portuguese forward, 37, has signed a huge deal estimated at €200 million after glittering spells at Manchester United, Real Madrid and Juventus. “I’m a unique player. It’s good to come here, I broke all the records there (in Europe) and I want to break a few records here,” Ronaldo told media at Al Nassr’s Mrsool Park stadium.
