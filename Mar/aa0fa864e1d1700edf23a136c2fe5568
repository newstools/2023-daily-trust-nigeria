The Oluwo of Iwoland, Oba Abdulraosheed Adewale Akanbi, Sunday empowered over 200 residents of the land with sewing and grinding machines as well as food items. A statement by his press secretary, Alli Ibrahim, said the empowerment, aimed at cushioning the effects of the naira crisis on the people, was facilitated by a son of the soil, Mr Tunde Rahman, to complement the Oluwo Food, Clothing and Empowerment Bank. Oluwo also assisted over 50 traders with N5,000 cash each to sustain their various businesses, saying he was aware of challenges facing traders owing to the new naira regime. Expressing optimism that the empowerment would alleviate the suffering, he urged government at all levels to empower small scale businesses to cushion the effect of naira scarcity. Oluwo said he had earlier planned to launch an elaborate cash empowerment, but was constrained by the naira scarcity to give N5,000 each to the over 50 beneficiaries. He stated: “I felt the pain inflicted on Nigerians, most especially the petty traders. This is one of the best moments to extend helping hands to those struggling to survive. The naira scarcity has heightened the hardship. Hence, the need to come to their aid. I have strong hope in my people to multiply any little given to them. “The distribution of 30 sewing machines, 25 grinding machines, hundreds of bags of rice, semovita, groundnut oil, etc is to decimate the hardship inflicted on Iwoland residents. Small scale business owners are primary beneficiaries.
