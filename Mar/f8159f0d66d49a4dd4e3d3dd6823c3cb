 Mainstream Foundation has sponsored successful cataract surgeries for a 12-year-old blind girl in Baro, Agaie LGA of Niger State. Ramatu Shuaibu regained her sight after suffering from cataract for three years while in primary three. The cataract surgery was conducted at the Eye Centre of the Minna General Hospital and sponsored by the Mainstream Foundation, the Corporate Social Responsibility arm of Mainstream Energy Solutions Limited (MESL). MESL operates over 1,200 megawatts (MW) Kainji and Jebba hydropower plants, and has been named operator for the new 700MW Zungeru hydropower, all in Niger state. Speaking in Minna yesterday after the successful operation on both eyes, the Consultant Ophthalmologist, Dr Halima Isah, said Ramatu could now see and identify things. Narrating the ordeal, Ramatu’s father, Mallam Shuaibu Mohammed, recounted the several futile efforts before taking part in Mainstream Foundation’s medical outreach in Bida. “We thank Allah today that with the intervention from the Mainstream Foundation, my daughter can now see and very soon she will go back to school to continue her education,” Ramatu’s father said. In her remarks, the Deputy Programme Manager, Mainstream Foundation, Zayyanu Illo Umar, said Ramatu’s case was one of the numerous cases handled by the foundation during medical outreaches in rural areas. He said, “We had to send her to Minna General Hospital to meet the doctors who are resident here. So, when they came to Minna, they gave us the cost implications and they did the two eye surgeries successfully. Now the girl can see.” Mr Illo said the foundation met with the chairman of the Niger State Universal Basic Education Board (NSUBEB) to ensure that the girl was re-enrolled in school just as it provided financial support for uniform and other needs.
