Nigerian champions Rivers United will today kick-off their CAF Confederation Cup campaign as they bid to become the first Nigerian side to win the competition. The Pride of Rivers qualified for the Confederation Cup group stages in November after defeating Libya’s Al Nasr Benghazi 6-1 on aggregate in the qualification playoff, and are drawn in Group B alongside ASEC Mimosa (Cote d’Ivoire), Diables Noirs (Congo), and DC Motema Pembe (Democratic Republic of Congo). Rivers United are the only Nigerian club team left on the continent this season after the elimination of Remo Stars, Kwara United, and Plateau United during the qualification series. The Port Harcourt club will start their group stage campaign with a trip to Diables Noirs today, before returning to Nigeria to host ASEC Mimosa in their first home match, seven days later. Rivers United cannot use their Adokiye Amiesamaka Venue in Port Harcourt because CAF declared that the stadium did not meet the conditions for holding continental club matches. The current prize money for the CAF Confederation Cup winner is $1.25 million, with the runner-up receiving $625,000 and the semi-finalists receiving $450,000. Teams that are eliminated in the quarterfinals will receive $350,000.
