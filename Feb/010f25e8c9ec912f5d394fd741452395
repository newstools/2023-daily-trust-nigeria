The Executive Secretary of the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission, Hajiya Saratu Umar has said that the Commission is currently initiating steps to partner with states in ensuring Nigeria maximises its potential in attracting Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs). Umar stated this yesterday in Abuja at a stakeholder engagement for heads of investment promotion agencies in states. She said the engagement became imperative to brainstorm ways to drive investment in the 36 states of the federation and the FCT. “There has been a lack of coordination between the national investment promotion agency which is the NIPC and the subnational investment promotion agency which is why there is a need to strategise to deepen investment drive at the state level, especially with the coming of the African Continental Free Trade Area Agreement. “The coordination by the NIPC will provide and ecosystem for mutual and complementary roles to ensure Nigeria maximises its potential under the Nigeria Investment Promotion master plan,” she explained. Speaking further, the NIPC ES said a national council for investment promotion will be put in place for easy coordination of investments while the NIPC will enhance capacity for investment promotion action and implementation among states. She added that about 188 countries of the world are competing for investment opportunities and Nigeria must take its place in the global market by becoming a strong investment destination.
