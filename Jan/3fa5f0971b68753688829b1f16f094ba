The Presidential Candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi, has vowed to give special attention to women if he becomes president. He made the promise while responding to questions at the People’s Townhall 2023 organised by Channels Television on Sunday. Obi vowed to revisit all the bills relating to women which were rejected by the 9th National Assembly. Five gender equality bills were all rejected by the National Assembly in March 2022. The rejected proposals which seek to alter the Constitution are Bills 35, 36, 37, 38 & 68 which are: bill to provide for special seat for women in the National and State Assembly, a bill to expand the scope of citizenship by registration, bill to provide for affirmative action for women in political party administration, bill to provide criteria for qualification to become an indigene of a state in Nigeria and bill to give women a quota in the federal and state executive councils or ministerial and commissionership seats. When Obi was asked about what he would do about the rejected bills, he said: “We will revisit them”. “I will re-present the bills and they will be passed under me,” Obi said.. While assuring the gathering that his government would try to do things in a way that Nigerians will see results, he said youths and women would be a critical part of his government.
