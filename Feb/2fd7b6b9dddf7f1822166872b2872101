The National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) has received N168.8 billion from tax levy in 13 years. The agency also projected that Nigeria could earn up to $40 billion annually if it produces two million software developers to meet global needs. Director-General of NITDA, Kashifu Inuwa, who disclosed this at a joint stakeholder meeting with the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), stated that a recent PwC report revealed that there was a need for about four million software developers globally. “On average, a developer earns between $25,000 to $130,000. So, let’s say because you are in Nigeria and you are working remotely, you will earn only $20,000, if we can provide those two million developers to the global value chain, Nigeria will earn 40 billion US dollars per annum, which is more than the remittance and oil and gas,” he said.
