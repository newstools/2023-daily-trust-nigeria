Following the tension created by the scarcity of both the old and new naira notes, the Lagos State Police Command has ordered the deployment of regular and anti-riot policemen to banks and financial institutions in the metropolis to forestall a breakdown of law and order. In a telephone chat with Daily Trust, the spokesman of the command, Benjamin Hundeyin, said the command decided to deploy armed policemen around banks and financial institutions in the metropolis to prevent breakdown of law and order as experienced in some states. He said, “The Lagos State Police Command is not unaware of what happened in Ibadan and some other parts of the country and is not ready to take chances. “It is in the light of this that the state’s police boss has ordered the deployment of additional security to banks and financial institutions. Security tightened around banks, financial institutions in Lagos Wike directs security agencies to clampdown on cultists “The command is also not unaware of the frustration and pains which the scarcity of the naira must have inflicted on Lagosians. However, as responsible citizens, Lagosians are advised not to take laws into their hands as the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and all other banks work round the clock to restore normalcy. if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[580,400],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_3',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');“Parents and guardians are also advised to appeal to their wards to stay away from trouble as anyone or groups of persons arrested for their alleged involvement in the breakdown of law and order will be made to face the music squarely.” He added that it was in anticipation of a crisis that the command on Friday met with Chief Security Officers (CSOs) of banks over the scarcity of the naira notes.
