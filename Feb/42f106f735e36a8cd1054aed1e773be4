The House of Representatives election for Kabba/Bunu/Ijumu federal constituency in Kogi State has been declared inconclusive by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The returning officer, Dr. Adams Baba, declared the result inconclusive in Kabba, the collation centre for the federal constituency, on Sunday. He said the candidate of African Democratic Congress (ADC), Salman Idris who polled the highest votes of 13,867 in the election is deficient by the electoral law to be declared winner of the election. He added that the number of cancelled votes from two polling units in the federal constituency was higher than the margin of votes between the ADC candidate and his closest rival. Dr Baba therefore stated that the difference of the results between the winner, Arch Salman Idris of African Democratic Congress (ADC) and the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Kolawole Matthew, was not up to the number of registered voters in the canceled polling units; thus, “the election is declared inconclusive” . “The ADC candidate polled 13,867 while the APC polled 13,605 leaving just 262 votes difference, whereas the number of PVC collected in the cancelled polling units of Iya in Otu ward in Kabba/Bunu LGA (485) and Open Space polling unit in Egbeda ward of Ijumu LGA (100) is more than the difference”, he said. The returning officer, however failed to mention when rerun election will be conducted at the affected polling units in the constituency.
