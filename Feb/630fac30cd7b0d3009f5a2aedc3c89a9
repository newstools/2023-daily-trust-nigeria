The Manager of the Nigerian Ports Authority, NPA, Calabar, Mr Iyke Olumati, has said the long-awaited dredging of the Port will commence in a few weeks, as all litigations on its operation and contract formalities have now been settled. The manager also disclosed that other technical matters, which were inimical to the port, were also being handled. Olumati made the confirmation when the Commissioner for Trade and Commerce in the state, Rosemary Archibong, alongside the management team of Great Elim Resources Ltd visited the port to see its ability to export iron ore. He said the state government has always shown interest in generating the much-desired cargo that will keep the Port busy, as well as generate employment for Nigerian youths and improve the economic well-being of the state. It would be recalled that the dredging of the port to enable mega-ships to berth suffered various challenges and government bottlenecks over several years. Responding to the welcome remarks, the Commissioner said they came to explore the possibility of exporting iron ore and coal from the port. She expressed excitement over the imminent dredging of the port. She assured that the state government was committed to maximizing maritime trade internationally and within the Gulf of Guinea trade sectors, which informed the Bakassi Deep Sea Port Agenda.
