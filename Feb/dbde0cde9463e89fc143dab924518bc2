Manchester City shrugged off the uncertainty caused by a series of Premier League charges to close to within three points of Arsenal at the top of the table with a 3-1 win over Aston Villa on Sunday. Rodri, Ilkay Gundogan and Riyad Mahrez all struck before halftime at the Etihad to edge ominously into Arsenal’s rear-view mirror ahead of a clash between the two on Wednesday. Arsenal still have a game in hand, but City will now move to the top of the table should they win at the Emirates in midweek. The Gunners’ 1-1 draw at home to Brentford on Saturday opened the door for City.
