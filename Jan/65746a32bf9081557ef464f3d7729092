PDP to Buhari: Sack Keyamo for ‘abusing’ office Buhari commissions $1.5bn Lekki Deep Seaport, rice mill, blue rail, others today “We in the North East are probably the most beneficiaries of your administration. In fact, we were the first to start enjoying your administration more than any other part of Nigeria, because Boko Haram was technically defeated immediately after you came into office and you appointed our son, Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Tukur Yusuf Buratai and, of course, Air Marshal Sadique Baba Abubakar, as Chief of Air Staff. “They did so well that your government gave the security that we are enjoying today. The North East, from 2015 particularly, enjoyed the most important appointments in your administration. That is to say that you are a northeasterner. This crowd is a testimony. Everywhere you go is Buhari, in the northeast.” Lawan thanked the President for the many developmental stride for both human and capital benefits the North East enjoyed from his administration.
