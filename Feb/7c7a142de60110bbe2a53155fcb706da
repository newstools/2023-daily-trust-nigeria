Three policemen gunned down at Ebonyi checkpoint You&#8217;ll regret if you don&#8217;t vote for me, APC guber candidate warns Ebonyi clan The governor’s brother, who serves as Director General of the Divine Mandate campaign organization, Hon. Austin Umahi, also escaped the accident. Addressing journalists at the residence of Nwifuru, who is the incumbent speaker of the state house of Assembly,  Umahi gave glory to God for saving their lives. “Yes, there was an accident but the hand of God was massively behind us. We came under divine mandate, and God has demonstrated it. “This accident would have been avoided, but unfortunately, we don’t know whether the truck driver was drunk. “Because I narrowly escaped it and the next vehicle was our candidate’s vehicle. And the man just crossed the road and pushed them into a bush. It’s unfortunate. “But we thank God for everything because the candidate has no scratch, the two other persons and the drivers in the vehicles also had no scratch”, he explained. On whether it was deliberate, he said, “This is an accident because I was told an accident is a sentence and it can happen to anybody.”
