The presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Sunday met with the governorship and National Assembly candidates of the party in Abuja, ahead of the February 25 and March 11 elections. Tinubu, who told the candidates to ensure they do not fail the delegates and party members who gave them the various tickets to contest, said he had been eager to meet with them. He said Nigerians and members of the APC were expecting a new lease of life from the candidates. “I am pleased to meet with you today (Sunday) because in you I see our party’s hope and path to success. In you I see the hope of historic national progress as well. “As so often in life, victory is not a cause for rest or celebration. It is a call to a greater challenge and harder toil. “Thus, you all have won the primaries but now must climb the higher mountain called the general elections. “We formed the APC, not just to be another political party. We formed it as a champion of the people, to rescue democracy from the ravages of the PDP who boasted of ruling the nation for 60 years.”
