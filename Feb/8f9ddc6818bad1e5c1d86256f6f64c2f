The Lagos Water Corporation (LWC) has commenced the test running of the Iju and Adiyan waterworks to increase water supply to Lagos metropolis. The exercise followed the completion of rehabilitation works embarked upon by the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu-led administration. City & Crime reports that the waterworks have the combined capacity of about 80m gallons per day. The LWC, in a statement, explained that some areas were likely to begin to experience huge leakages as a result of increase in pressure, while areas that had not received water supply in a longtime would experience supply. Following the development, the corporation launched phone numbers for reporting non- availability of water, burst pipes, leakages and acts of vandalism. The statement reads in part: “Our experienced and dedicated staff are at alert to respond to any leak, burst, query or enquiry.”
