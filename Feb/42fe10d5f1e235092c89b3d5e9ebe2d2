The governorship candidate of the Labour Party (LP) in Kano State, Bashir Ishaq Bashir, has confirmed meeting the presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, in Abuja on Sunday. Pictures of the LP candidate trended on social media on Sunday, with allegations that he has defected to APC and has abandoned his governorship ambition. But speaking to our correspondent yesterday, Bashir confirmed meeting Tinubu, but said a formal statement would soon be made on his next step. However, one of his associates, who asked not to be named, told Daily Trust that Bashir and other party leaders had concluded plans to defect to the ruling APC, citing exclusion of major Northern stakeholders in the decision-making process of his party.

Yesterday, LP’s Chairman in Kano, Mohammed Abdullahi, said the party remained committed in their support to the Obi-Datti candidature. Though the chairman did not categorically mention Bashir’s name, he alleged that there were people planning to leave the party, but that it was their personal decision that had nothing to do with the party leadership.
