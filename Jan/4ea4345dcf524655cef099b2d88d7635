A former speaker of the Kogi State House of Assembly, Hon. Alfa Imam, has defected from the All Progressives Congress (APC) alongside his supporters to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The former speaker, who led thousands of APC members from Lokoja LGA in the state to the PDP in a ceremony in Lokoja yesterday, claimed that the ruling party had failed the country. Imam said he was overwhelmed with the warm reception given to him by the PDP,  stressing that his defection to the party was not to seek an alternative to the APC,  but rather,  a move to work with the party that has a structure and organised leadership. He promised to work for the PDP’s victory in the forthcoming general elections, adding that “his journey to PDP is a privilege and not a right.” Earlier, Senator Tunde Ogbeha who received the former speaker on behalf of the PDP, assured the party members that the factor of the former speaker would change the political narrative in the state. “Alfa Imam is welcome to PDP. I must thank him for his foresight, empathy and courage. I call on all lovers of peace and progress to come out of their hiding places and join PDP,” he said.
