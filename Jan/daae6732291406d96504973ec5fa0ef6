The Kaduna State gubernatorial candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Uba Sani, has promised to prioritise education if elected. Sani, who disclosed this at Giwa town on Tuesday at the flag-off of the APC campaign rally in Kaduna, noted that Governor Nasir El Rufai brought back the lost glory of public schools. “My priority is to make quality education accessible to the siblings of the common man because that will guarantee them a better future and improve society at large,” he added. Governor El Rufai urged the people to vote Uba Sani as his successor and Dr Hadiza Balarabe as his deputy because “they were part of the team that enabled the transformation of Kaduna State under my leadership.”
