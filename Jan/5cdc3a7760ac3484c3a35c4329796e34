With social media still awash with complaints over the delay in the take-off of the “Lagos Loves Damini” show on Sunday, an insider source has revealed what caused the incident. The insider, Edgar, the Chairman, Duke of Shomolu Productions, a theatrical plays producing outfit, who is a close associate of Wonder X, organisers of the show, blamed the delay on unforeseen circumstances. He explained, “A lot is being said about the just-concluded mega concert featuring global star, Burna Boy. A lot of stories have come out from different sources, especially eyewitness accounts, detailing the delay in the show and the very unprofessional attitude of the star who came out cursing and spending quite an unacceptable time on stage despite the long wait for him.

He continued, “The star, Burna, did not help matters as he seemed to have a beef against the Lagos audience as he came out cursing and abusing them.” Edgar, however, expressed happiness that the show could be termed a phenomenal success as Burna Boy was able to rise above the initial delay to deliver some of his hit tunes. “That excellent delivery made the crowd forget their initial misgivings and they danced the night away. This was a learning experience for all stakeholders involved, especially the organisers, who would have to beef up their technical capacity and also seek an efficient working relationship with authorities, especially in traffic management and security. “I have heard reports of the Lagos State Government removing number plates from parked vehicles of attendees. Organisers must tackle such issues well in advance. “In all, it was a wonderful experience as Nigerians were given another wonderful opportunity to watch their beloved Olu Burna who, despite it all, gave a wonderful, albeit brief, show to the satisfaction of the crowd.” (NAN)
