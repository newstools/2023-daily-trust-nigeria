The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, has promised that if voted to power he would revive the Ajaokuta Steel Company in Kogi State to create jobs for young Nigerians.

Also, the Chairman of PDP in the state, Engr Sam Ohoutu, said the resounding welcome that attended the campaign rally of the party’s presidential candidate was evidence of acceptance.
