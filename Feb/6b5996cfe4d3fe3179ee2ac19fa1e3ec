The ActionAid Nigeria and the Global Peace Development (GPD) have sensitised about 1,000 women in 12 communities in Kaduna State on the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to improve their lives. The programme which took place in the communities where ActionAid’s SARVE III Project is being implemented, was to mark the International Women Day (IWD). At Narayi community, a GPD resource person, Malextive Abeekyaa, said the sensitisation was aimed at bridging the digital gap among women and to improve job opportunities and means of earning income for women. She said, “Globally, it has been noticed that women are always left behind when it comes to certain aspects of life like engineering. A few women are gradually coming in and when you look at the digital space, you will see that there are more men than women. “The United Nations has predicted that 1.5 trillion dollars will be lost because women are not participating in the digital world and that is why we are creating awareness to the women in the grassroots that the mobile phones are not only for calls, but that there is a lot they can do with their phones.” A participant, Victoria Bamaiyi, said she was better informed on the need to open bank accounts and take advantage of the ongoing cashless policy in the country to expand her businesses.
