For the first time in more than 40 years, the Scout Association of Nigeria (TSAN) is set to host its national parade and awards in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). In a press conference, the Chief Scout Commissioner of Nigeria, who doubles as the Chief Executive Officer of TSAN, Mr Dave Padopads-Awunah, said the five-day event was kicking off on January 28. He said the event was aiming to converge young scouts from across the country to socialise under a common scout arena and create awareness on the existence of scouting in Nigeria. He explained that TSAN would award its “messenger of peace” and “ambassador of peace” awards to President Muhammadu Buhari who was the national patron of the association. He further said that in two years TSAN intended to grow its active members to 10 million from its over three million members presently in the country. Adding that, “The programme is geared towards having the Federal Government of Nigeria make a policy for compulsory scouting in all public primary and secondary schools in Nigeria. “The programme will have our government of Nigeria reinstate the policy of monthly subventions and grants to the 26 state scout councils and the National Scout Organisation since it was stopped for almost three decades. if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[250,250],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_3',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');“Sadly, scouting has over the years diminished to the disadvantage of young people and the nation. The clear absence of the role of scouting in tailoring the minds of young people is clearly shown in the inexplicable crisis of youth mismanagement.”
