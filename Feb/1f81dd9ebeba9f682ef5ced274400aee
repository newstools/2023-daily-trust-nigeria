Business activities have yet to pick up in Jos metropolis 48 hours after the Presidential, Senate and House of representatives elections, the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). A correspondent of NAN who went round Jos metropolis on Monday reports that most restaurants and shops remained closed and those opened had only a few goods displayed outside. The Terminus Market, which usually has human and vehicular traffic, had less people and vehicles. Mrs Ngozi Anosike, a trader at Terminus Market, attributed the low turnout of people to the alleged fear of an outbreak of law and order as a result of the turnout of the results of the elections. “People are at home to avoid any form of violence that may arise due to the results of the elections,” she said. Similarly, Mr Amos Pam, said that most people “are cautious and are staying home to avoid being caught in any form of violence that may arise due to the elections”. Mrs Tabitha Adams, who said she was in the market to buy food stuffs for her family, expressed fear on the reduced people traffic in the market. “I am very scared, as we speak, the market is not booming and I need to leave quickly as I am not comfortable with the atmosphere,” she said. NAN reports that most banks which usually have a mammon crowd at their Automated Teller Machines (ATM) were empty and the major roads in the metropolis were void of the usual vehicular traffic. NAN also reports that most primary and secondary schools in Jos-Bukuru are closed and are to resume in March. The Commissioner of Police in Plateau, Mr Mamman Dauda, said the security personnel had been ever ready to sustain peace in the state during and after the elections. He assured the residents that nothing could disrupt the normal socio-commercial activities in the state. (NAN)
