Deputy Governor of Lagos State, Dr. Kadir Obafemi Hamza, has urged Kwarans residing in Lagos to protect their heritage by voting the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the Governorship and House of Assembly election. He spoke at an event in Lagos tagged, “Kwarans in Lagos endorse Sanwo-Olu” coordinated by the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed. Obafemi, who represented his boss, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, in his remarks in Yoruba told the gathering that by re-electing Sanwo-Olu and himself on Saturday, the people of Kwara would be protecting their heritage. He said Lagos is too important to be handed over to “dullards,” adding, “Lagos issue is not an experimental situation.” My son is an activist, not a politician, says Lagos LP guber candidate&#8217;s dad Your forefathers won&#8217;t forgive you if you vote against Sanwo-Olu, Lai tells Lagos-based Kwarans Reiterating that the Lagos should not be handed over to some inexperienced lots referring to the opposition party candidates, he urged the people to prevail on their children to retrace their steps and stop being deceived by the social media lies of those he called, “Obistupid.” Daily Trust reports that the Obidients’ movement represented by the Labour Party defeated APC in the penultimate Saturday’s Presidential election. But Obafemi noted that the defeat was due to the failure of the people to come out and vote, appealing to the Lagos-based Kwarans to mobilize their children of voting age to vote for APC and stop following the Obidients. He said, “Lagos is very important in Africa. It is too important to be handed over to a dullard. The opposition candidates are inexperienced to lead the state. We have to stop them with our PVC. “What happened before was because we didn’t mobilise enough. They came out en-masse with their children and all family members.
