A former governor of Abia State and the South East Coordinator for the Atiku/Okowa Presidential Campaign, Senator Theodore Orji, has said the Igbo have confidence in the ability of the PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, to fulfil his campaign promises to the people of the region if given the mandate in the February 25 poll. Inaugurating the PDP campaign in the state yesterday, Orji said Atiku is the best and most qualified candidate to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari on May 29. “He (Atiku) does not play with Igbo; he has promised what he would do for Igbo when he leaves office. Ala Igbo has confidence in Atiku just as he has confidence in us,” Orji said. He charged the members selected from the 17 LGAs of the state to show commitment, loyalty, and hard work in order to deliver PDP candidates in the elections.
