The Katsina emirate council has confirmed the dismissal of a top district head, the Makaman Katsina, the district head of Bakori, Idris Sule Idris, for allegedly aiding and abating terrorism in his domain. The dismissal was contained in a letter dated 19, January, 2023, signed by Kauran Katsina, district head of Rimi, Aminu Nuhu Abdulkadir, who is a king maker and a senior council member of the emirate. The letter said Makama was dismissed after a state government committee had found him guilty of charges leveled against him by his people. “Following a letter the emirate council received from the office of the Secretary Government of the State with reference number SEC/54/Vol. VI/1416, in which the executive governor confirmed that the allegations against you are true. “The issues raised against you have led to disruption of peace in your area. The emirate council therefore wishes to inform you that you’ve been relieved of your duties as Makaman Katsina, district head of Bakori,” the letter read in part. When contacted, the emirate spokesperson, Ibrahim Bindawa confirmed the sack, saying “Yes, it is true.” This is not the first time traditional rulers with alleged links to terrorists would be fired. In 2021, Katsina emirate council dismissed Sarkin Pawwan Katsina, the district head of Kankara, Yusuf Lawal for alleged support to terrorists.
