 The State Working Committee (SWC) of the Labour Party (LP) in Oyo State has declared support for the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mr Seyi Makinde, in Saturday’s election. Addressing journalists at the party’s state office in Ibadan on Sunday, party Chairman, Mr Tunji Sadiq, said the party had resolved to use its entire structure throughout the 33 LGAs of the state to support the re-election bid of Governor Seyi Makinde. Sadiq said the party decided to support the PDP candidate because his ideology aligned with that of the LP in the aspects of security, infrastructural development, agriculture and industry, health, financial independence and economic wellbeing of the people. Sadiq said, “On our thorough assessment of the various governorship candidates for the March 11, 2023, election in terms of character, competence, capacity and compassion for people, His Excellency, Engineer Oluseyi Makinde, excels above the others. “Therefore, we at the Labour Party, Oyo State, have decided to use the entire structure of our party throughout the 33 local governments to support his re-election for another four years of giant development in Oyo State. And we call on all citizens of Oyo State to vote massively for him. He deserves it.” But the governorship candidate of LP in the state, Taofiq Tayo Akinwale, has dissociated himself from his party leader’s rally and support for Governor Makinde’s second term agenda.
