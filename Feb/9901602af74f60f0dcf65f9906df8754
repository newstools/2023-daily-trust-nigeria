The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Bauchi State yesterday pointed fingers at each other over Monday’s killing at the latter’s governorship campaign rally in Akuyam community in Misau LGA. Two persons were shot at the rally and one of them died after they were rushed to the Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Azare. The Director General of the PDP campaign organisation in the state, Faruq Mustapha, alleged that the escort of the APC gubernatorial candidate, Air Marshal Sadique Baba Abubakar (Rtd) shot the two persons. Mustapha, at a press conference yesterday in Bauchi, denied the claims that PDP supporters attacked the APC convoy which prompted Sadique Abubakar’s escort to open fire. The Director, Media and Communications, to Air Marshal Abubakar, Salisu Barau, alleged that the party’s campaign train was attacked by the opposition’s supporters. He said despite the attack, they pleaded with APC supporters not to take revenge. Barau said, “Our people were attacked and about 15 to 20 cars were smashed. Some people from our own side got injured.” if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[300,250],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_3',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');When contacted, police spokesman in Bauchi, Ahmed Wakil, confirmed the incident and said the Commissioner of Police, Alminu Alhassan, had ordered a discreet investigation into the incident.
