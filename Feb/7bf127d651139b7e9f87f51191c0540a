A 40-year-old man, Chuks Emenike, has suffered a broken shoulder after falling into a well in the Byazhin Across area of Kubwa in Bwari Area Council of the FCT. Emenike’s neighbour, Hassan Tajudeen, told City & Crime that around 7pm the victim returned home and sat close to a well as he waited for his brother to open their door for him. He said the victim, who forgot he was sitting close to a well, swayed backwards and fell into it, hitting his head against the wall of the well, breaking his shoulder and sustaining other severe injuries. He further said, “Emenike’s brother was surprised to discover his brother inside the well when he came out and alerted neighbours who assisted in bringing him out. His shoulder was broken and he was severely injured.” Emenike’s landlord, Mr Tunde Adeolu, said, “He was rushed to the Kubwa General Hospital but was referred to the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital in Gwagwalada. He is receiving treatment.”
