A former executive secretary of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), Professor Usman Yusuf, has said that the people of Katsina State would not vote for the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu. Usman Yusuf, a special adviser on community engagement to the Atiku/Okowa presidential campaign, stated this during an interview on Channels Television on Monday. On February 6, during thr APC presidential campaign rally in Katsina, President Muhammadu Buhari raised Tinubu’s hand, which is a sign of endorsement. But during the interview, Yusuf said the people of Katsina State are tired of the APC rule. He said, “Our politics in Katsina has been vibrant from the beginning. We are not the people that anyone would say vote for this. If President Buhari raises his hand in Katsina. We will not vote for him. “People are tired, they are fed up. They brought hired crowd from Kano, we saw the buses from Kano. Ganduje loaded them from there. These politicians do a lot of stuff, so don’t believe the optics. The reality is on the ground.”
