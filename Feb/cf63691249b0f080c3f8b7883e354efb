Fish mongers under the aegis of the Association of Fish Sellers, on Tuesday, protested the rejection of the old naira notes in Abeokuta, Ogun State. The market women, who were armed with leaves, lamented the inability to buy fish owing to the enforcement of the cashless policy of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). They said they staged the peaceful protest to show their displeasure following the rejection of the old naira notes by wholesalers at cold rooms, noting that many businesses had shut down. They added that both the banks and the wholesalers had refused to accept the old naira notes as legal tender.
