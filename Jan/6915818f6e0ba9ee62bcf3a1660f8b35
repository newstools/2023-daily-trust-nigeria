Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal of Sokoto State has cautioned eligible voters in the state against selling their Permanent Voters’ Cards (PVCs). Speaking during their campaign tours of Binji and Tangaza LGAs Tuesday, the governor alleged that some people were buying PVCs in their attempt to rig the forthcoming elections in the state. “Don’t give them your card. Your card is the only weapon you can use to elect the candidate of your choice,” the governor said. He urged the people to vote massively for PDP candidates in all elections, saying doing so would ensure the continuity of the “laudable projects” initiated by his government. In his remarks, the governorship candidate of the party, Sa’idu Umar, promised to build on the programmes and policies of the present administration if given the mandate.
