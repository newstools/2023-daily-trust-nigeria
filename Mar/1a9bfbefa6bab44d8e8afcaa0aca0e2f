An octogenarian, Mrs Kudirat Yusuf, has urged the incoming President of Nigeria to prioritise prompt payment of pension. Mrs Yusuf, who retired from the Voice of Nigeria (VON), spoke on Tuesday in Lagos, noting that it was the responsibility of the government to care for the aged and pay pensioners. She said, “I want the incoming president to know that it is the responsibility of the government to care for the aged. “I am a pensioner, and if there is anything I am enjoying from the current government, it is the payment of my pension as at and when due. “I wish that anybody that wins the election should continue in that tempo. Whoever wins should do better than what we are experiencing now.” She further said basic amenities such as electricity, water, food, security, good roads and infrastructure should also be prioritised.
