Bayelsa State deputy governor, Senator Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, has urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and President Muhammadu Buhari to do everything for the country to have free, fair and credible polls this year. Speaking with newsmen shortly after attending the New Year’s Day mass at the Saint Paul’s Catholic Parish, Ofoni in Sagbama LGA of the state Sunday, Ewhrudjakpo described  2023 as a year that offers great possibilities for Bayelsa State in particular and Nigeria in general. In a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media, Mr Doubara Atasi, the deputy governor who thanked Bayelsans for their support and resilience, emphasised that 2023 has a positive outlook with great opportunities for the state despite the challenges facing the country. He however pointed out that for such opportunities to become reality, Nigerians, especially those in authority, must strive to abide by the rules governing the conduct of public affairs. He said, “First of all, we want to thank God for guiding us through 2022; a very turbulent year, but God saw us through. And now we are in 2023 by His grace and mercy. “2023 is a year with a lot of possibilities. It is an election year, and we believe that the federal government and the electoral umpire will do all that is necessary for us to have a free, fair, credible and equitable election.”
