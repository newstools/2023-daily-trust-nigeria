Ex-Super Eagles captain Austin Jay-Jay Okocha and his wife, Nkechi are celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary. The Nigerian football star marked the occasion by posting a lovely photo of himself and his wife on his verified Instagram page on Tuesday. The 48-year-old ex-footballer who played 73 times for the Nigeria’s national team between 1993 and 2006, scoring 14 times, and was a member of three FIFA World Cup squads, is regarded as one of the greatest African football players. Taking to his Instagram account, the master dribbler simply captioned the picture, “Happy 25th wedding Anniversary to the wife of my youth,” a message that was accompanied by several love emojis. Shortly after his post, friends, family and fans trooped to his comment section to congratulate the couple.   The couple tied the knot in 1997, and the union has produced two children named Daniella and A-Jay. Okocha spent about thirteen years with the Nigerian national side and won the 1994 African Cup of Nations (AFCON) with the Super Eagles. He featured in five AFCON tournaments for the three-time African champions and was part of the Olympic gold medal-winning side in 1996. The midfield maestro, renowned for his skills, also won the BBC African footballer of the year on three occasions.
