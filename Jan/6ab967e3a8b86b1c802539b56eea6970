A former presidential candidate and interim government campaigner, Rev Chris Okotie, has said that Nigeria’s future is guaranteed only when the country is restructured. In continuation of his interim government campaign which he began in 2019, Okotie, yesterday, said that for Nigeria to overcome the 2023 global economic headwinds predicted by experts there was the need to put in place strong governance structures and a stable polity, noting that such ingredients were absent in the 1999 constitution. The cleric said,in his New year message released by his media adviser, Ladi Ayodeji in Lagos yesterday said unless his Aboriginal Democracy proposition is adopted, the country could flounder under a severe socio-political and economic crisis. Okotie observed that given the fact that 80 per cent of Nigeria’s income is used to service its current debt which is projected to climb to N77 trillion this year, the country has no choice under the current constitution than to keep borrowing to run the country.

He said, “In the light of this reality, a new constitution is required to deal with all the existential problems in all spheres of our national life, which is why Aboriginal Democracy is recommended.” He urged his congregation and other Nigerians to pray for the peace and prosperity of Nigeria. He said, “Every member of this church should continue to set aside a few hours to pray for Nigeria because the Household of God was set up to play a pivotal role in the destiny of this country, that’s why I am involved in the political process.”
