The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has set May 17, 2023, as the deadline for all mobile networks to fully migrate from the diverse shortcodes to harmonised codes. In a statement on Monday, the NCC said the old and new harmonised shortcodes would run concurrently until May 17, 2023, when all networks are expected to have fully migrated to full implementation of the new codes. The period between now and May 17 is provided by the NCC to enable telecom consumers to familiarise themselves with the new codes for various services, the statement signed by NCC’s director of public affairs, Reuben Mouka, said. NCC had earlier directed mobile network operators (MNOs) to commence implementation of approved harmonised shortcodes (HSC) for providing certain services to telecom consumers in the country.
