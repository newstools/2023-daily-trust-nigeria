Under the guidance of a strong general, there will never be weak soldiers You’re one of the strongest life generals I have ever known. You have run a good life race. You represent all that is desirable in leadership. You have been a crusader of positive impact without bitterness. They say when life gives you a lemon, make out a lemonade. It is indeed an apparent fact that you have made a huge lemonade out of life. You’re one of the greatest life generals I have ever known. You’re the boss of bosses, captain of captains, and mentor of mentors. You have been a sage of radical positive development so much so that we look up to learning from the series of magic you perform in impacting genuine sustainable development in the lives of all those who found themselves around you. Indeed, sir, words can’t adequately express how grateful I am on this occasion of your 50th birthday. Your birth is one of the greatest miracles to ever happen to our generation. You have been a courageous, brave, and compassionate leader committed to positively impacting and empowering younger generations. With every deep sense of joy and excitement in me, I wish you a happy and prosperous golden jubilee. Big congratulations to you on your 50 birthday, Dr. Mohammed Alhaji Danjuma Signed: Mr & Mrs Ataguba Enemku H.
