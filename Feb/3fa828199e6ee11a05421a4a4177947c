He said inspite of the progress made, the federal government is working towards recording zero cases of cVDPV2. He said “We want to finalise and fine tune those plans that will make ensure that by the end of 2023, we will have completely eradicated every single form of polio whether it is circulating variant or wild polio virus.” He said we are not completely free of polio until every single type of polio is eradicated from Nigeria. “What we’re trying to do is to ensure that the solidarity and collaboration that led to the eradication of the white polio virus in Nigeria is sustained. We’ve worked with multiple donors and partners to achieve what we’ve been able to do in the last six years going on seven in terms of maintaining a zero wild polio virus transmission,” he added.
