The Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) has announced that taxpayers can now get their tax clearance certificates with a single click on Taxpro Max solution. Daily Trust reports that the TaxPro Max is a tax administration solution introduced by FIRS in June 2021 as a one-stop-shop for taxpayer registration, tax returns filing, tax payment and tax clearance certificate requests, among other activities. In a statement yesterday by the Special Assistant to the Executive Chairman, FIRS, Muhammed Nami, on (Media & Communication), Johannes Oluwatobi Wojuola, said generation of the certificates, which used to be issued within a period of 2 weeks will now be available on a single click by the taxpayer. He said the innovation was on the heels of wide-scale technological reforms that the service has embarked on in its bid to achieve hundred per cent automation of its tax administration functions. Nami noted that the new mode of certificate generation was in line with the objectives of the service to make the lives of taxpayers easier and ensure the ease of doing business in the country. “One of our objectives as a service is to build a customer-centric institution. That means an institution that has the customer at the heart of its innovations and solutions. “It is for this reason that we have tuned the operations of our TaxPro Max solution to be able to deliver tax clearance certificates in the shortest possible time to taxpayers as long as they do not have any liabilities. At the click of a button, a taxpayer will get their tax clearance certificates, as long as they have no outstanding liabilities,” he said.
