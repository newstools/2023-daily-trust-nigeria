Prompt response by detachment of soldiers and police Friday averted attacks on two commercial banks in Jalingo, the Taraba State capital, Daily Trust Saturday reports. It was learnt that trouble started when an alarm was raised that two almajirai died around Hammanruwa Way in Jalingo after they allegedly ate free food given to them by a woman. Following the report, some hoodlums mobilised and chased after the woman, who ran inside one of the commercial banks to avoid being lynched. The hoodlums, it was gathered, demanded the woman be released to them and attempted to forcefully enter the bank. However, a distress call was sent to both 6 Army  Bridgade  headquarters and to the Taraba police command in Jalingo who promptly deployed  detachment of soldiers and police to disperse the hoodlums. Daily Trust Saturday’s finding revealed that two Automated Teller Machines at the front of Unity Bank were destroyed by the hoodlums before the arrival of the soldiers and police. The spokesperson of the Taraba police command, DSP Usman Abdullahi, told our correspondent that it was not true that two almajirai died after eating free food given to them by the woman. He said the woman gave the almajirai food but they did not eat the food because needles were allegedly found in the food she gave to them. Abdullahi said that when she was arrested, on interrogations she confessed that the food was for a ritual purpose, adding that she was directed to give to the almajirai to realise an ambition by a ritual killer.
