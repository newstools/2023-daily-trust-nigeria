The Federal Government has been urged to use the Central Bank of Nigeria-issued digital currency – eNaira, to pay workers’ salaries as well as contractors handling various projects as part of measures to boost its cashless policy. The Chief Executive officer of indigenous tech firm BULLNET, Bayo Akintoye, who disclosed this at a media parley in Lagos, said the adoption of the USSD channel of the eNaira can be employed to soothe the pain felt by Nigerians given the current scarcity of cash as the country transits from a predominantly cash-based economy to a cashless one.
