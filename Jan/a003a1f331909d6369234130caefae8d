The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Ogun Area II Command, has called on its officers and men to discharge their duties professionally, have integrity and be disciplined. The acting Comptroller of the command, Ahmadu Shuaibu, gave the charge during a sensitisation programme organised to celebrate the International Customs Day. He described the job as a noble one with positive impacts on the nation and its economy, urging the officers to be proud of what they had and to protect the name and image of the service by doing what was right at all times. Shuaibu noted that beyond professionalism, the officers equally had to adopt diplomacy while carrying out their duties.
