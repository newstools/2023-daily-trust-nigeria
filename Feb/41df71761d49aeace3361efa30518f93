The 23-year-old marriage between Mr Isiaka Odeyemi and Mrs Feyisola Odeyemi has been dissolved by an Ado-Ekiti customary court over idolatry. The President of the court, Foluke Oyeleye, dissolved the marriage over incessant fighting, fetishism, threats, among others. Odeyemi, who dragged his wife to court alleged that she worshipped things with alcohol and kola nuts, which he did not support, alleging further that she killed her first child and that the two other children she had for him were not doing well. He said, “I suspect that the two children are into internet fraud, popularly called Yahoo Yahoo.” Mobile app launched to combat fake news UNICEF, Kashere varsity counter fake news He also alleged that his wife did not give him rest of mind, saying that she was fond of fighting with him, and therefore prayed the court to separate them. if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[580,400],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_3',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');The respondent, Feyisola, noted that her husband was in support of her religion, saying he normally took her to an Ifa temple in the mornings and came back to pick her in the evenings. She said, “I was told to worship Ifa; my husband participated in the worship too. We used to worship Ifa together.” She denied that her children, Femi (22) and Taye (19), were into internet fraud, noting that they were doing fine. The President of the court, Oyeleye, who observed that the marriage had broken down completely, ordered that both parties should do what they liked because the court would not separate what was not in existence. He held that, “Though the parties had been cohabiting for 23 years, all the requirements of a valid marriage are absent in this relationship.” He, therefore, ruled that there was no marriage between the parties and that they were free to go their separate ways.
