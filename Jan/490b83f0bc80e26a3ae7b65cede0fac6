A woman reportedly died on Sunday while her husband and son suffered injuries when the motorcycle they were riding to church crashed in Abeokuta, Ogun State. Our correspondent gathered that the bike swerved to avoid a head-on collision with another motorcyclist coming from the opposite direction at the Obantoko end of the Abeokuta-Ibadan-Asero Road. In the process, the woman fell off and hit her head on the road as the motorcycle swerved. The spokesman of the Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps (TRACE), Babatunde Akinbiyi, confirmed the accident on Sunday in Abeokuta. He said soon as the other motorcyclist saw the damage done, he sped away from the scene. Akinbiyi added that the accident happened opposite the Mobil Petrol station, Obantoko outbound Abeokuta-Ibadan Road, at about 9am, and caused a heavy gridlock along the axis. He said, “Her corpse has been taken by the family for burial at Osiele axis.” if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[300,250],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_3',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');While commiserating with the family of the deceased, the TRACE PRO warned motorcyclists to be careful, cautious, patient, and avoid speeding.
