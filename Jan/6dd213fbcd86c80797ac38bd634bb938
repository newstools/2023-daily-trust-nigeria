A former deputy governor of Niger State, Ahmed Musa Ibeto, has tendered his resignation as a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its presidential campaign council. Ibeto announced his decision in a letter he addressed to the APC Chairman, Ibeto Ward in Magama Local Government Area of the state on Tuesday. He said his resignation from the APC was due to internal crisis and unending litigations in the party which he believed were threats to the success of the APC in 2023 in the state. He also announced his resignation as the Assistant Secretary of the North Central Directorate of Mobilisation and from all organs of committee of the APC.

An official of the party in the state told Daily Trust that Ibeto’s resignation from the APC was one of the many resignations expected from APC members as the party prepares for 2023 elections. “These resignations are motivated by selfish interests. We expect more of them to defect but what we want to assure is that we will continue to work for the party to win. Most of them that are leaving have no political relevance. So, we don’t bother,” the official, who preferred anonymity, said.
