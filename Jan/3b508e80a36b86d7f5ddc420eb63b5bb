A former governor of Kano State and presidential candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, has cautioned Nigerians against voting along ethnic and religious lines in the forthcoming general elections. Kwankwaso spoke yesterday when he visited Edo State governor, Godwin Obaseki, to seek the support of the electorate in the state ahead of the February 25 poll. He said, “Nigerians should not play politics of ethnicity and religion, vote only credible and competent leaders. “Some people don’t even understand the realities on the ground today. Every Nigerian is looking for a way out. Nobody is waiting for a neighbour or any leader to say this is the way. 2023: 10 major promises of Atiku, Tinubu, Obi, Kwankwaso Buhari: How Kwankwaso’s SUV gift helped me survive Kaduna bomb attack “Any party or candidate that comes out in the face of ethnicity or with the issue of religion, that party or candidate at the national level has failed in the election even before it starts. if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[300,250],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_1',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');“What Nigerians are saying is who can save this country in terms of insecurity, economy and dilapidated infrastructure that we see.
