Gunmen on Tuesday went on the rampage, burning the Afor Atta divisional police headquarters in the Njaba Local Government Area of the state. The attack came less than 24 hours after the convoy of a former governor of Imo State, Ikedi Ohakim, was bombed and four police orderlies killed. Our correspondent gathered that the attackers threw explosives at the police station. However, no policeman was said to be on duty during the attack. The incident was said to have caused apprehension in the community as residents remained indoors throughout the day. Our correspondent recalls that the same police station was in June 2021 vandalized after two courts beside it were burnt. Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) in the state, CSP Mike Abattam, could not be reached for his reaction via his phone as it was switched off when our correspondent called. He had also yet to issue a statement on the incident.
