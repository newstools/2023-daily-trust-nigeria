A group known as Pan Idoma Congress (PIC) on Saturday appealed to all people of Benue State to cede power through their votes in next week’s governorship election to the Idoma tribe as the area was yet to govern the state 47 years after its creation. The group said it was worried that since the creation of Benue State on February 3, 1976, the Idoma tribe which is second largest ethnic group had not for once tasted the foremost seat of power in the state. Speaking through its National Treasurer, Ambassador Onoja, the PIC noted that though, the state consists of three major tribes of Tiv, Idoma and Igede with other smaller ethnic groupings such as Jukun, Etulo and Nyifon among others; only the largest tribe Tiv has continued to hold onto power over the years without relinquishing it to their other brothers.
