About nine female students of Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, Anambra State, were reportedly raped when armed robbers invaded their hostel in the early hours of Friday. The robbers who were estimated to be about 20 had stormed Ifite road, Awka, where the hostels were located shooting indiscriminately and robbing from room to room. A student of the university, who would not want her name mentioned, told reporters that the robbers were heavily armed with guns, axes and matchets. â€œWe were at the hostel when we had gunshots that lasted for about ten minutes and we ran for our lives because they had not gotten to our own hostel; we hid at the back of some shops in the area.
