Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to sack the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, over the current naira redesign and swap policy crisis. Akeredolu spoke yesterday while playing host to Seyi Tinubu, the son of the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, who led members of the Youth Directorate of the APC Presidential Campaign Council (PCC). Akeredolu said the policy was meant to de-market the Bola Tinubu and frustrate his ambition on February 25. The governor, who noted that Nigerians were feeling the hardship occasioned by the swapping of the old and new naira notes, added that Emefiele was no longer fit to continue heading the apex bank. He said, “We have said that this man (Emefiele) should be removed when he contested to be president. The man is not fit for that position. A man who attempted to be president will frustrate us at this time.” Akeredolu faulted the timing of the introduction of the redesigned naira notes and demanded that the policy be reversed immediately. He said, “We have a problem we are facing in this country today. Our rating as a party is not that favourable. Let’s not deceive ourselves. Must it be now that we will have this financial policy? “Things are not easy. This policy is not right at this time. It should be reversed. Reserve it and tell CBN that we are reversing it. Let old and new notes co-exist. “We didn’t waver when we said that the presidency must come to the South, and when it got to the South we didn’t waver. “We said competence and track record are important. Our choice of Asiwaju was premised on an informed decision not because we are from the same tribe.” Earlier, the younger Tinubu saluted the governor for his commitment to youth development and inclusion, especially in Ondo State.
