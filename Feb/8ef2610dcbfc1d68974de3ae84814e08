The All Progressives Congress (APC) Presidential Campaign Council yesterday asked security agencies in the country to place pollsters and supporters of the Labour Party (LP) presidential candidate, Mr. Peter Obi on watch list. It said the recently conducted “fake opinion polls” which predicted victory for Obi has already prepared the minds of the ‘Obedients’ that LP would win this Saturday’s poll, adding that if that does not happen they would resort to violence. ANAP/NOI and Nextier had conducted opinion polls which predicted victory for Peter Obi this Saturday. Addressing newsmen on Wednesday in Abuja, the Special Adviser on Media and Strategic Communications of the APC Presidential Campaign Council, Dele Alake, said the ruling party’s candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu would win the election, but expressed fears that ‘Obedients’ would cause violence after  Tinubu’s declaration as winner of the poll. But reacting, the Spokesman of the LP Presidential Campaign Council and former Chairman of Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC), Dr. Yunusa Tanko, said it is APC leaders that should be placed on watch list, saying ‘Obedients’ are not perpetrators of violence and have no plan to cause post-election crisis. Tanko also called for arrest and prosecution of APC leaders, insisting that “they have been attacking our supporters, and maiming our members who are harmless. They should be arrested and prosecuted for their atrocities. Security agencies should take this seriously.”
