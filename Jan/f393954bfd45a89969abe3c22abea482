The Edo State governor, Godwin Obaseki, has advised Nigerians not to sell their Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs) but make use of it in the forthcoming general election to choose credible leaders. Obaseki, represented by his deputy, Philip Shaibu, made the call Sunday at Auchi, Edo State, during the annual Auchi Day celebration of Almighty Allah. He said, “2023 is very crucial so I appeal to Nigerians, particularly the good people of Edo State to make good use of their PVCs starting from February 25th to elect God-fearing people in positions of authority. “If you are a registered voter and you have not collected your PVC go and collect your card from the nearest INEC office and if you have it already, don’t sell it to selfish politicians who would want to mortgage our future.” He said the election is very crucial because it will usher in people into the executives and the legislative positions, urging Edo North district, as the second highest voting population in the state to use their PVCs wisely and vote for credible leaders. He said Nigeria has no reason for the present economic hardship, security challenges and the people living in abject poverty, saying it is time for the people to use their PVCs to elect leaders with capacity to deliver good governance. He commended the Otaru of Auchi, Alh. Aliru Momoh, Ikelebe III, for ushering peace, unity and development to the Auchi Kingdom.
