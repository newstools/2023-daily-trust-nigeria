According to Abdulsalami, the meeting was organised to ensure proper conduct of the candidates, their parties and other stakeholders, especially during the campaigns ahead of the elections.

Gen. Abdulsalami who assured that his position was noted, however said that Sowore could leave if he was not still satisfied.
