Poland’s top seed Hubert Hurkacz toppled home hope Benjamin Bonzi 6-3, 7-6 (7/4) in the final of the ATP 250 tournament in Marseille on Sunday. It was world number 11 Hurkacz’s sixth title on the ATP tour. A semifinalist at Wimbledon in 2021, Hurkacz left Bonzi, 60th in the rankings, still searching for his maiden title after losing in the final in Pune, India, at the start of the year. Hurkacz silenced Bonzi’s vociferous supporters, firing down 19 aces and holding firm in the tie-break to get off the mark for 2023.
