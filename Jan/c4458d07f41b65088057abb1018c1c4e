The Divisional Police Officer (DPO) of Seme Police Division in Lagos State, SP Mojeed Salami, slumped and died in his office on Tuesday. Though the actual cause of death was not known, a police source who spoke to our correspondent Friday said the DPO had earlier complained of a minor headache and had gone to a hospital. He said the DPO returned to his office a few hours later and resumed work, but that hours later he called his orderly and complained that he was feeling somehow. The source said, “He asked his orderly to call the Divisional Crime Officer (DCO). I think he wanted to hand over to the DCO. “The orderly met him on the floor gasping for breath. He was rushed to the Badagry General Hospital where he was confirmed dead.” The Lagos police spokesman, Benjamin Hundeyin, said, “He died on Tuesday. It was shocking to everybody because there was nothing serious about his health. They said he just complained about a minor headache, went to the hospital, came back, commenced work and died shortly afterward.”
