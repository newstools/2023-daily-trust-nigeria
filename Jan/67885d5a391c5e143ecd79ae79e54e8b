Governor Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State has said only God can stop Asiwaju Bola Tinubu from succeeding President Muhammadu Buhari. Speaking in Kokona Local Government Area while flagging off the campaign of the party’s senatorial candidate for Nasarawa West, Architect Shehu Tukur, Sule said APC governors in the north would use their resources to ensure Tinubu emerges victorious. He said, “APC Northern governors will use their resources to ensure that Tinubu emerges president of the country. If there is anybody that wants Tinubu to become president, it’s the Northern APC governors. “Only God can stop Tinubu and A. A Sule from becoming president and governor respectively. We are determined to commit our resources and strength to conquer any form of opposition.

The APC Northern governors stood firm for Tinubu to emerge, they will do anything to make him president. Disregard any of such lies emanating from people who are seeking favours from Tinubu,” he stated. In his address, National Chairman of the APC, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, urged the people to vote for all the candidates of the party from top to bottom. He said it will not augur well for Tinubu and Sule to emerge president and governor respectively but to have members of the opposition as members of the national and state assemblies.
