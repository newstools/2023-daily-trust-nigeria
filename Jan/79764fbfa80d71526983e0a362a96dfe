The Federal High Court in Maiduguri has disqualified a former House of Representatives member, Mohammed Umara Kumalia, from contesting the Borno Central Senatorial District seat in the 2023 general elections on the platform of the PDP. While delivering the judgment in Maiduguri yesterday, Justice Jude K. Daggard, said Barr. Kumalia did not participate in a valid primary and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) ought not to have recognised the acclaimed rerun that produced him.
