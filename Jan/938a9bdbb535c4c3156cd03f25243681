Ahead of the commencement of the $2.59 billion Deep Seaport in Badagry, the Nigerian Navy, on Thursday laid the foundation of the Admiralty Shelter Estate, Topo-Badagry for the effective deployment of troops to the area. It could be recalled that the Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, had in October 2022, said he received approval to build the  $2.59 billion Badagry Deep Seaport, which was approved by the Federal Executive Council (FEC) in August. The approval provides legal basis for the concession of the Badagry Deep Seaport, following the issuance of the full business case certificate by the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC) last April. Sensing a sharp rise in commercial operations when the seaport becomes operational, the Chief of the Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Awwal Zubairu Gambo, approved the construction of the Admiralty Shelter Estate, Topo-Badagry, to enhance the operational efficiency of the navy around the Badagry waterways. Speaking at the groundbreaking ceremony, the CNS said the Admiralty Shelter Estate, in Topo, Badagry, was embarked on under a joint venture partnership arrangement between Navy Holdings Limited and Messrs Jewel Shelter Constructs Limited. “Just last month, precisely on the 3 December 2022, a groundbreaking ceremony for the development of 147 houses at Cluster H at the Admiralty Estate, Asokoro and 150 units of Post Service Housing at the Navy Estate Karshi Phase 3 were conducted.
