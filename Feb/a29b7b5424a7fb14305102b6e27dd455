Marcus Rashford showed Manchester United wonâ€™t be distracted by the race to buy the Old Trafford club as his double inspired a 3-0 win against Leicester on Sunday. Rashford has scored 24 times in all competitions for United this season, the highest goal tally he has ever managed in a single campaign. Remarkably, 16 of those goals have come in 17 appearances since he returned from the World Cup in December. The 25-year-old is also the first United player to score in seven consecutive home league games since Wayne Rooney in 2010.
