 The family of Professor Gertrude Njar, the Commissioner for Women Affairs in Cross River State who was kidnapped over one month ago has taken its cries to the Inspector General of Police (IGP) in a petition. Prof Gertrude was kidnapped in the early hours of February 1, 2023, while on her way to the office in her official Renault car. She was kidnapped on Atamunu Street in Calabar by armed men dressed in military fatigue, according to the petition signed by one Prince Odey Oyama dated March 2, 2023. The family said that the kidnappers drove a white Hilux and had since demanded a N150m ransom through phone number 09074056593. The petition reads in part: “It is one month now since her kidnap without any positive results. This has given our entire family, community, friends and well-wishers deep concern.” They called on the IGP to use his office to assist in tracing the woman. When the incident happened, the Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Eric Anderson, assured that the state government would do everything possible to rescue her.
