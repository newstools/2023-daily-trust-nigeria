The Ogun State gubernatorial candidate of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), Biyi Otegbeye, has criticised Governor Dapo Abiodun over his refusal to reinstate 75 Obas demoted by his government despite an order from a competent court asking him to do so. Speaking at the Palace of the traditional ruler of Magboro town, HRH Modiu Ademuyiwa, during his campaign tour of Obafemi Owode Local Government Area on Tuesday, Otegbeye said if elected governor on March 11, his administration will obey the court order and reinstate the monarchs. It will be recalled that 75 Obas were installed during the administration of Senator Ibikunle Amosun but were sacked by Dapo Abiodun when he assumed office in 2019. The traditional rulers, not satisfied with that action, went to court to challenge the decision. They got a favourable judgment as the court ordered their reinstatement. However, the government has not reinstated them.

Governor Dapo Abiodun has no regard for the traditional institutions, and there are many instances to validate this. Why would Obas who were legally installed by previous administration be unilaterally removed without recourse to due diligence? “Even when they got judgments on two occasions for them to be reinstated, he refused to obey the sacred orders of the courts as if we are in a banana republic. Instead of doing the right thing, he decided to break the ranks of the monarchs by selectively reinstating a few of them.”
