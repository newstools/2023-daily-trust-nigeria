The Managing Director (MD) of the Jos Electricity Distribution Plc, Engr Abdu Bello Mohammed, has called on the military, particularly the Nigerian Air Force (NAF), to help in safeguarding the company’s installations from vandalism. The MD made the call last Tuesday when the newly deployed Commander of the 551 NAF Base, Jos, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet, paid him a courtesy visit. The Company’s Head, Regional Operations, Engr John Emeruwa, who represented the MD, disclosed that the rate at which vandals were decapitating transformers in Plateau State was alarming. Earlier, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet, said his visit was to familiarise himself with the management of Jos Electricity Distribution Plc as the two institutions played complementary roles in the security of the state, stressing that, “There is a relationship between security and light.”
