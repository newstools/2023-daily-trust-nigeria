Emma Raducanu says she hopes she will be fit for this month’s Australian Open but is trying “not to expect too much”. The 20-year-old Briton retired from her second-round match at the ASB Classic in Auckland on Thursday after slipping and rolling her left ankle. The Grand Slam begins next Monday, with the full extent of the 2021 US Open champion’s injury yet to be diagnosed. Raducanu left the court in tears last week after rolling her ankle during the second set against Slovakia’s Viktoria Kuzmova, with the score 6-0 5-7. The world number 75 is hoping to improve on her second-round exit in her Australian Open debut in 2022.
