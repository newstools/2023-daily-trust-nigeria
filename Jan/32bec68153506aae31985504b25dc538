Ahead of this year’s general elections, the Deputy President of the Senate, Sen. Ovie Omo-Agege, has called on the people of Aladja to join him to stop the “Okowa dynasty of illiterates” in the state. Omo-Agege made the call when he visited the Aladja community for his campaign. He and his supporters were received by a mammoth crowd in Aladja, where he dared the PDP as he toured the community. The federal lawmaker said the people should vote en masse for all candidates of the APC in the coming elections. Sen. Omo-Agege promised to do whatever the Aladja community wants, stressing that he knew the pains of the people. He also promised to build a second bridge for the Udu people and provide employment opportunities for the unemployed youths in the area.
