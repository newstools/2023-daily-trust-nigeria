Roberto Martinez has officially been appointed as the new head coach of Portugal’s national team after days of speculation. Martinez takes over from Fernando Santos who was sacked after a calamitous World Cup outing in Qatar that saw them exit at the hands of Morocco in the quarter-finals. The Spanish Head Coach himself had a disappointing tournament with Belgium after they bowed out in the group stage before resigning. His side were outclassed but survived against Canada, were embarrassed by Morocco, and then frustrated by Croatia. Martinez’s first role will be to lead Portugal to Euro 2024 glory in Germany after failing to land any major trophy with a star-studded Belgian squad.
