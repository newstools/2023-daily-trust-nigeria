The Federal Government on Tuesday assured that the 2023 general elections will be held as planned. The Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, gave the assurance in Abuja during the 17th edition of the President Muhammadu Buhari Administration’s Scorecard Series (2015-2023). He was responding to inquiries from the media over a recent report credited to an official of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) that the 2023 general elections faced a serious threat of cancellation due to insecurity. The minister said the position of the Federal Government remained that the 2023 elections would be held as planned.
