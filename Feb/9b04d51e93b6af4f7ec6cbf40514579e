 The Technical Adviser of Doma United, Coach Akinade Onigbinde, has expressed satisfaction with the performance of his players in the first round of the 2023 Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) abridged season. Doma United who are making their debut in the Nigerian topflight finished the round in 6th position with 12 points from three wins, three draws and three losses in nine matches, As a matter of fact, they finished ahead of their more illustrious group opponents like Enugu Rangers who are behind them in seventh position, Wikki Tourists in eighth, Dakkada in ninth position while Bayelsa United are last on the Group B table. Doma United also inflicted the only defeat on the defending champions, Rivers United when they fought back to win 2-1 in their week six match at the Pantami stadium Gombe. Reacting to his team’s performance, Onigbinde said he was proud of what he has achieved with his boys in their first season in the NPFL. The former Road Safety Abuja coach attributed his team’s impressive run so far to God and hard work on the part of everyone in Doma United. “Some people have said they are surprised by our performance and I understand with them because most of them doubted our abilities. “But we didn’t allow anything to discourage us. We know our worth as a team and we stayed focused. “As a matter of fact, we are yet to play up to fifty percent of our potential,” said Onigbinde. The young gaffer, therefore, said Doma United will achieve more positive results in the second stanza to qualify for the Super 6 from Group B.
