South Korea’s Ko Jin-young became the first player to retain the HSBC Women’s World Championship title after firing a three-under par 69 in the rain-interrupted final round to beat world No 2 Nelly Korda by two shots in Singapore on Sunday. Still battling a wrist injury that derailed her 2022 season, Ko burst into tears after her triumphant return at Sentosa as she finished with a 17-under par total of 271 at the no-cut tournament with a $1.8 million prize purse. Ko was unflappable on the front nine and although she faltered with a bogey on the 11th, she sank a 30-foot putt for birdie on the 13th and a two-foot par putt on the final hole to edge Korda (69) for her first title since last year’s win. “It’s a great honour to defend this title and I had a great week, and a long week as well, with all the rain,” said Ko, who will bank $270 000 for her win. “Before this week I practised really hard. I knew I was defending so I wanted to get one more trophy. It paid off and I’m really happy.” Unlike her comeback win last year, Ko did not need a five-birdie charge in the last six holes, instead holding on to her overnight lead with a masterful display as she joined compatriot Park In-bee as the only two-time winners of the tournament.
