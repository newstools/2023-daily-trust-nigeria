Christian Atsu, the Ghanaian footballer who was declared missing after the earthquake that shook Turkey nearly a fortnight ago, has been confirmed dead. The deceased played in the Turkish Super Lig. He had scored a last-minute winner for his club, Hatayspor, in their home game against rivals, Kasimpasa, a day before the devastating event. There was temporary relief when the Ghanaian Football Association said Atsu had “been successfully rescued from the rubble of the collapsed building and is receiving treatment”. But this was refuted by Murat Uzun Memhet, the football star’s agent.
