The management of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) has cited the support of the Maritime Workers Union of Nigeria (MWUN) as a critical success factor in the long-drawn process of securing approval for an increase in the salary of its workers, which had stagnated since 2008. Commenting when he received a letter referenced MWUN/MD/NPA/RFC/23 dated March 6, 2023, signed by the Secretary General MWUN expressing appreciation to the management of the authority for increment in the salary of its members, the Managing Director/CEO NPA, Mohammed Bello Koko, said, “breaking the jinx of salary stagnation suffered for over a decade by the authority’s employees was made possible with the support of the MWUN, and we remain appreciative.” He added that “this critical support from MWUN has buoyed us to intensify our relentless drive towards continuous improvement in the welfare of our esteemed workers in ways not limited to monthly salary alone.” It would be recalled that the NPA managing director was in November 2022 accompanied by the president general of MWUN, Comrade Adewale Adeyanju, on an advocacy visit to the headquarters of the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) to solicit its solidarity towards an increase in NPA workers’ salaries.
