The candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the Dawakin Tofa, Rimingado and Tofa Federal Constituency of Kano State, Abba Umar Ganduje, has promised to be an active lawmaker if elected. The son of the Kano State governor, Dr Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, also pledged to deliver dividends of democracy to his constituents. If elected come February 25, Ganduje will replace Tijjani Abdulkadir Jobe, who is a fourth termer in the House of Representatives. At an interactive session with newsmen in Abuja, he said his experience both in the private and public sectors would help him to address the challenges of his constituency. “My well-articulated programmes will be tailored to address the deprivations that the people in our constituency have suffered over the years under the incumbent lawmaker. “I intend to serve through effective and efficient representation and by bringing the dividends of democracy to the people of our constituency,” he said. He also said he would, at all times, bring into focus the concerns of his people on the floor of the Green Chamber. if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[336,280],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_3',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');“Getting to the National Assembly on my people’s mandate by God’s grace, my programmes will come through the promotion of legislation that will address our peculiar needs and through direct personal interventions to support the great people of my constituency.”
