The Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD) has urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to ensure more registered voters collect their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) in readiness for this year’s polls. The CDD Director, Idayat Hassan, who made the call yesterday in a statement, also urged registered voters to pick up their PVCs, especially now that the cards are being distributed at the ward level. She said, “However, while ongoing efforts to bring the PVC collection process closer to voters at the grassroots are commendable, CDD expresses its utmost concern that the preparations for the elections may be undermined if the growing insecurity across the country is not urgently addressed. “It is disconcerting that despite the directive of President Muhammadu Buhari mandating the security agencies to secure volatile parts of the country by December, unending waves of attacks by elements contesting the authority of the Nigerian State have not abated.” CDS Irabor bags Online news platform&#8217;s Award My health challenge stale news, rubbish – Tinubu She said in the South East, Biafra separatist agitations continue to undermine the peace as separatists attack government buildings, while threatening to unleash mayhem on voters who dare to show up at their polling units on Election Day. if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[250,250],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_3',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');She added that in the South West, pockets of agitations led by Yoruba nation separatists have similarly disrupted public order and peace, while news of the recent abduction of 31 passengers at the train station in Igueben, Edo State, in the South-South is also disturbing.
