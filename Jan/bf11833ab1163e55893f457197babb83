Christophe Galtier sucked up another painful Ligue 1 defeat for his Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) team on Sunday and told his 2022 World Cup stars they must find their focus again. PSG began the year with a seven-point lead at the top of Ligue 1, but that has been clipped to three after defeats to Lens and 1-0 loss to Rennes. Galtier will face scrutiny for such domestic losses, given the superstars at his disposal, and he knows he and the team must start to show their best again. “I’m mainly disappointed with our performance. We didn’t create anything; we had very few favourable situations. “I’m not going to talk about worry, but there has to be awareness. We can find a thousand excuses, but the World Cup is over. “We focused on having possession of the ball and we had far too many players who dropped back without having players high enough to secure the Rennes defensive line,” he said. PSG had only eight attempts on goal, their lowest total in a league game this season, and only one went on target. if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[300,250],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_3',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');The defeat was a third in their last four trips to Rennes in the league, with the Breton side firmly established as a bogey side for the capital giants. Galtier pointed to issues with Lionel Messi and Neymar having no obvious targets when looking to move the ball forward.
