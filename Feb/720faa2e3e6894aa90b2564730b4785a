 The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), in partnership with Gogetit, has commenced training for 23,000 agents who will implement e-Naira adoption in the rural areas of the 23 LGAs of Benue State. Gogetit’s Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Orkuma Hembe, said at the weekend that they were in Benue to educate people on how they could migrate from the physical economy to the digital economy. Hembe said: “We intend to train at least 100 people per local government. So, in the 774 local governments across the nation, we will be training at least 100 agents in every local government who will serve as an extension, more or less, of the central bank where they will provide basic services to communities, markets, localities, provide basic services on how to use the e-Naira and also transact the e-Naira.” Hembe added that the participants included the motorcycle hirers association, agri-produce associations and the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW).
