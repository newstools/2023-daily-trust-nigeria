A group of Northern elders under the aegis of the Northern Alliance Committee (NAC) led by elder statesman, Alhaji Tanko Yakasai, has asked the presidential candidates of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar; and the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi; to accept the outcome of the February 25, presidential poll. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had announced candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, as winner of the election, but Atiku and Obi are challenging the outcome of the poll in court. Answering questions during a press conference on Sunday in Abuja, Yakasai, who is the grand patron of the committee, said the election was free and fair, stressing that the minority would have their say but the majority would have their way. He said, “That is the beauty of democracy. The minority will have their say, but the majority will have their way. We the Northerners have more than 70 per cent of the over 200 million people in this country and we have decided the future of the country. “The law provides that whoever is not satisfied with the outcome of the election should go to court; that is the beauty of democracy. “The natural thing for all to do now is to give the president their maximum support in the task of tackling the many issues bedevilling our country which need all hands to be on deck in handling.”
