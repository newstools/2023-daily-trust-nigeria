The Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) has frowned at some petroleum product retail outlets that are not accepting payment from customers by Point of Sale (POS) machines. In a statement on Thursday, the regulator said outlets must accept PoS to ease the cash crunch brought about by the new naira design. “The authority frowns at this recent behaviour which is causing untold hardship for Nigerians at a time when all hands should be on deck to assist the government in the transition to the new naira. Naira may weaken after new notes circulate, as Ghana’s Cedi appreciates Naira crisis: Food traders count losses, slash prices of wares “All retail outlets are directed to ensure the free use of PoS and bank transfer for the sale of petroleum products to alleviate the suffering of customers at this critical time,” it directed. NMDPRA also said it will work with security agencies to be at retail outlets to ensure compliance with this directive and any filling station found violating this directive will be duly sanctioned. “We reassure the general public of our commitment to ensuring good quality service in the sale and distribution of petroleum products nationwide,” it said.
