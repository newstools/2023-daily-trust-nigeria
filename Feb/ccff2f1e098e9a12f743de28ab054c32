A Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO), E-Health Academy (EHA), has graduated its fourth cohort of fellows who received free training and mentorship on software engineering in Kano. EHA, which is a subsidiary of E-Health Africa, said the fellowship was in their effort to bridge the gap in Information Communication Technology (ICT), especially in the area of software engineering. Speaking during the graduation ceremony, Senior Manager, Software Engineering and lead for the implementation of EHA, Jamil Galadanci, said the 10-week intensive programme was offered to underprivileged youths to provide them with the skills and resources necessary to succeed in the technology industry. One of the students, Aisha Mujahid Kabir, who just graduated from secondary school and willing to study computer engineering, said the training had opened her eyes to the field and that she was motivated to do more.
