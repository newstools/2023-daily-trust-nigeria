Professor George Obiozor, one of Nigeria’s finest and most renowned academics, diplomats, statesmen, patriots, and foremost Igbo leader, died on  December 26, 2022. At the time of his death, Obiozor was the President-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, the apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation. A citizen of the world in the true sense of it, he served at the highest levels of Nigeria’s foreign policy establishment, rising to the top as Director-General of the Nigerian Institute for International Affairs (NIIA) and Nigeria’s Ambassador to the United States, Washington, DC. His death was felt across the country. President Muhammadu Buhari said he was “deeply saddened” by his passing, and extended his heartfelt condolences to Obiozor’s family, the government and people of Imo State, as well as Ndigbo, at home and in the Diaspora. The president believes that “the contributions of the unique leader and strong proponent of peace and a stable polity,” will never be forgotten.  Former president, Dr Goodluck Jonathan, described his death as a huge loss to the nation, stressing that “Professor Obiozor left enduring legacies and would be missed not only by his family and friends but by the diplomatic, academic and cultural communities across the world.” if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[250,250],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_3',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');Born on August 15, 1942, in Awo-Omamma, Oru East LGA of Imo State, Obiozor had his education at Awo-Omamma Comprehensive Secondary School from 1959 to 1963.

As the leader of Ohanaeze, Obiozor faced personal losses and attacks. On 19 March 2022, his country home was set ablaze. The gunmen used an improvised explosive device (IED) to destroy the building, causing him to lose his personal library, property and mementos. He was deeply pained by the attack. Obiozor was a towering intellectual. In his death, Nigeria lost a foreign policy expert. He was not just a Professor of International Relations, he had also practised what he taught. He had a deep knowledge of international affairs and practised it. His loss is not just to his family but to Nigeria, as he knew his onions. As a well-known intellectual giant and leader, he will be missed. May God accept his exemplary service to Nigeria and the world.
