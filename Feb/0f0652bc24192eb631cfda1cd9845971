Dr. Umar Mustapha Muqaddas, governorship candidate of Labour Party, has defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC). Muqaddas, who announced his defection at a media briefing in Yola, the state capital, on Thursday, asked his supporters to vote for APC on Saturday. Asiwaju Bola Tinubu is the presidential candidate of the APC, while Peter Obi is the flagbearer of Muqaddas’ former party. Muqaddas said he had collapsed his Labour Party structure in Adamawa and his new party would be a beneficiary. He said his supporters came into the LP with the belief that it will provide the alternative that Nigerian politics needs by being progressive, truthful, inclusive and visionary. He observed that he and his supporters were disappointed because they found the people running the LP to be as bad as the system they were trying to change. He lamented that despite their efforts and good intention, they realised that they would go nowhere both at the national and state with structure set up by the Peter Obi Presidential campaign organization. “I have been completely sidelined and ignored even deliberately disrespected by LP structure both at the national and state and same applies for other candidates in the LP,” he said.
