The governor of Bayelsa State, Douye Diri and his Edo State counterpart, Godwin Obaseki, on Tuesday, called on the G5 governors of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to join hands with the party in its rescue mission to rebuild the country. The governors made the call in an interview with journalists shortly after a courtesy visit to the PDP Vice-Presidential Candidate and governor of Delta State, Sen. Ifeanyi Okowa, at his home in Owa-Alero, Ika North-East Area of the state. According to them, the PDP has not foreclosed speaking with the G5 governors because we want a strong and united party that will rekindle the hope of Nigerians.
