Manchester United and Crystal Palace have both been fined £55 000 for a mass confrontation between their players in a Premier League match earlier this month, England’s Football Association (FA) said on Tuesday. The incident took place in the second half of the 4 February game – which United won 2-1 at home – where Casemiro was shown a straight red card for appearing to grab Will Hughes by the throat when both teams clashed following a tackle on Antony. United accepted that they had failed to ensure their players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion and refrained from provocative behaviour but Palace had denied the charge.
