Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State has accused Godwin Emefiele, governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), of introducing the naira redesign policy because his presidential bid failed. The CBN governor was linked to the All Progressives Congress (APC)  presidential race, which he denied after a group purchased the N100 million presidential form for him. Speaking with BBC Hausa Service after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday, Ganduje alleged that the CBN governor does not want the elections to hold.

On whether the governors will part ways with the president on this policy, Ganduje said, “No, we are against this policy of naira redesign by the governor of the Central Bank and those surrounded the president.”
