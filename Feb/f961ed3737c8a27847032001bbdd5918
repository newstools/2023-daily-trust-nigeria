Our plea is that the community should find a lasting solution to it before the perpetrators graduate from animals to human beings.” The Vice Chairman of the community, Malam Audu Aminu, said he and his colleagues were also victims of the situation. He said, “We have lost several goats, particularly to these people. We don’t know why they have decided to focus on stealing our goats. “We have taken steps by engaging night guards, but that has not solved the problem. The present situation calls for us to review our security measures. We had not involved the police. But this calls for review.”
