A Kaduna-based Islamic Scholar, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi, has advised Muslims to unite and elect right and God fearing leaders in the coming election. He also urged Muslims to avoid any act capable of creating divisions among them for the peace of the religion and country. The scholar spoke at the N375 million launching of Dan fodio Mosque rebuilding in Kaduna State. According to him, Muslim unity is a directive by Allah if they want to be strong. “Leadership is like a mat very soon this mat will be rolled over.  Our unity is our strength and it’s a directive from Allah for Muslims to remain united if they want to succeed,’’ he said.
