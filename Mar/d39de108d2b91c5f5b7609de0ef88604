An area court in Kubwa, Abuja, has dissolved a 12-year-old marriage between a housewife, Amina Hamisu and her husband, Ibrahim Isyaku, over the latter’s desertion. The Judge, Malam Yahaya Sheshi, dissolved the marriage according to Islamic law following Amina’s prayer for divorce on grounds of abandonment. Sheshi added that considering the evidence given by the two witnesses, Mustapha Abdulrasheed and Hadiza Garba, it was eminent that the defendant neglected and starved the petitioner and their three children. He ordered Amina to observe Iddah (waiting period) of three months according to Islamic injunction before contracting another marriage. Earlier, the petitioner told the court that the respondent did not provide food, shelter, clothing and medication for the family. While giving evidence, the petitioner’s brother-in-law, Abdulrasheed, said that the respondent abandoned his wife and children without care in a village in Kano and that her family asked her to relocate and meet him in Abuja. He said, “Despite Amina relocating, her husband did not change. The family asked her to return to her sister’s house so that he can change but he did not.” Abdulrasheed added that the respondent also disrespected his wife’s parents and begged the court to dissolve the marriage since he was no longer interested. Despite the respondent denying the allegations against him, the judge dissolved the marriage. (NAN)
