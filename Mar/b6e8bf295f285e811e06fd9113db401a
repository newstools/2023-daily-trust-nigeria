Defending champions, Rivers United Saturday were unable to secure the maximum points against fierce rivals and neighbours in the rescheduled Match Day 9 of the 2022/23 abridged Nigeria Premier Football League (NPFL). The Pride of Rivers, who have been on continental duties came into the game at the Umuahia Township stadium with confidence but fell flat as the game ended 0-0 with the game living up to its billing as one of the most keenly contested and less entertaining, in terms of goals produced, in the NPFL. It was a lively start as both sides created goal-scoring chances which they failed to utilise well. In the 68th minute, the hosts had the golden opportunity to win the game when they were awarded a penalty kick. Bello Lukman stepped up and his effort from the spot was saved by the Rivers United goalkeeper, Darlington Ovunda as they ended their run of scoring goals in their last five matches in the league. Both sides have now drawn four times in the last six matches between them in the NPFL, with two wins for United. Rivers United have now moved to 2nd position in Group B on goal difference with 15 points while Abia Warriors are in 4th position with 14 points.
