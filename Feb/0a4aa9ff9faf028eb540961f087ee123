An anti-sabotage organisation , ‘The Natives’ has said it would be insensitive, shameful and insane for some political parties to boycott the February 25 and March 11 general elections on account of naira crisis in the country. Thirteen registered political parties in the country had threatened to boycott the elections should the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) extended the February 10 deadline for the use of old naira notes. But in a statement on Wednesday in Abuja, the president general of the group, Hon. Smart Edwards, condemned the action, saying they are insensitive to the plights of Nigerians. “The position of these 13 political parties is pointless, shameful and insane. We don’t hope there are Nigerians in these political parties,” the group said. It described the political parties as “agents of sabotage which are unmindful of the suffering of the Nigerian masses as a result of CBN current policy.” The group urged the CBN to urgently arrest the situation, and appealed to all stakeholders in the country to ensure the success of the general elections.
