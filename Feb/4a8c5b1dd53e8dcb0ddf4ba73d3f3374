The Supreme Court has affirmed the nomination of Colonel Kefas Agbu (retd) as the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Taraba State for the March 11 governorship election. A five-member panel of justices of the apex court on Friday upheld the decision of the Court of Appeal in Yola that dismissed two appeals by other governorship aspirants challenging Agbu’s eligibility. The lead judgment read by Justice Emmanuel Agim held that the appeal by Hilkiah Buba-Joda and Jerome Nyameh was in breach of sections 84 and 87(9) of the Electoral Act, 2022 by failing to explore internal dispute resolution mechanism as contained in the party’s guidelines. At a Federal High Court in Jalingo, Nyameh had challenged Agbu’s nomination as PDP candidate alleging the violation of Part VII, Article 1 of the Electoral Guidelines for the Primary Elections of the PDP, 2022, having failed to resign before purchasing the forms.
