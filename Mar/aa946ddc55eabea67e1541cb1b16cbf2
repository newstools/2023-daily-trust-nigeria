 The deputy governorship candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in Kaduna State, Mohammed Auwal Yunusa, Sunday dismissed reports that the party has adopted the PDP governorship candidate, Isah Ashiru. Yunusa told reporters in Abuja that APGA was not in alliance with any party in the state. He said, “I, Mohammed Auwal Yunusa, the deputy governorship candidate of APGA, humbly wish to debunk the position of APGA, Kaduna State chapter, forming an alliance with the PDP by adopting Isa Ashiru. “This is not the true position of myself and that of my party. APGA executives and the entire local government and ward executives dissociate themselves, including their excos. “APGA, Kaduna State, and its entirety are not in tandem with this undemocratic attitude of Rev Andrew Duya’s action. Dr Duya did not consult or discuss with the party’s exco on his decision.”
