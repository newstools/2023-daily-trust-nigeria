One person was killed in Jigawa State on Tuesday at a campaign rally of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kazaure LGA of the state. The police commissioner in the state, Emmanuel Ekot, told newsmen yesterday that the police were trailing the suspected killer, who was said to have fled to neighbouring Kano after committing the crime. “The police are on top of the situation. The suspect has fled to Kano. It’s a conflict within a party between those faithful to a particular candidate who disagreed among themselves. “They are members of the same APC, not a conflict between two parties,” the police commissioner said.
