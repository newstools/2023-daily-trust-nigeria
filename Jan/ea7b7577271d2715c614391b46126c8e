The FCT minister, Muhammad Musa Bello, has said the death of the Etsu of Kwali chiefdom, HRH Sha’aban Audu Nizazo (III), will serve as a reminder that every living soul must taste death. Bello, who stated this when he paid a condolence visit to the family of the late traditional ruler in Kwali on Thursday, called on people to be humble in life. The minister said the late monarch had been a peace-loving person, which, he noted, translated to peace and unity in his chiefdom. He recalled that he last met the late Etsu of Kwali at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, during the Christmas homage to the President, where they exchanged pleasantries, only for him to be told that he died four days later. “We met at the villa, and we even snapped pictures with the president, and four days later I received the sad news of his death,” he said. Also speaking, the Ona of Abaji, Alhaji Adamu Baba Yunusa, who received the minister on behalf of the bereaved family, appreciated his visit to the family and the entire people of Kwali chiefdom. He appealed to the minister and the chairman of the council, Danladi Chiya, to assist in shouldering the education of the late monarch’s children, saying he left behind two wives and 11 children. if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[300,250],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_3',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');On his part, the chairman of the council, Danladi Chiya, informed the minister that the late monarch had, before his death, requested that a new Etsu of Kwali chiefdom be appointed without delay whenever he died.
