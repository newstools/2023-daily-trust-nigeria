A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Arc. Bernard Yisa, has said the economic blueprint of the president-elect, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, will transform Nigeria in terms of growth and development. Yisa who was a governorship aspirant in Benue State on the platform of the APC, while congratulating Tinubu in an interview with Daily Trust, asked Nigerians to support the president-elect in his bid to provide good governance and put Nigeria back on track for rapid economic growth and development. He assured Nigerians that an APC-led administration by Tinubu would bring prosperity and stability to the polity, urging Christians not to bother about the Muslim-Muslim ticket. “The Tinubu/Shettima manifesto is best suited for Nigeria. There are several things to consider presently in Nigeria; religion is one of them, economy is one of them and security is also there and the unemployment of the youth. So religion is one aspect which should not make us lose focus of the general economic development of the nation,” he said. He said his home state of Benue will also benefit from the economic transformation of the Tinubu administration, especially when they vote Fr. Hyacinth Alia of the APC in the March 19 governorship poll. He stressed that Fr. Alia is the best option to move the state forward, adding that, “The APC governorship candidate in Benue is very popular and anywhere he goes people come out to listen to him so we are sure of victory in the poll and sure of sustained economic growth and development thereafter in the state and nation.”
