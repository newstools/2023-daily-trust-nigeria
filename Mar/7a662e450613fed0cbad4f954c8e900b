The newly appointed Technical Adviser of Wikki Tourists, Coach Abdullahi Adamu, has set the target to qualify the ‘Bauchi elephants’ for the Super 6 tournament at the end of the ongoing Nigeria Premier Football League (NPFL) abridged season. Wikki Tourists who are second from bottom in Group B with a paltry 8 points from a possible 27 are faced with relegation but the young gaffer in a chat with Daily Trust said there are no relegation worries for his team. He assured the club’s teeming supporters that Wikki Tourists will turn around their fortunes in the second round and qualify for the Super 6. The former Katsina United coach hinged his confidence on new acquisitions and the winning mentality he said he has been able to inject into Wikki Tourists players since his appointment as Technical Adviser.

Most of them were demoralised. They were weighed down psychologically. So, I had to psyche them up, to bring them back to life mentally and physically and that is what is giving us results. “In the last two seasons, we struggled to escape relegation but this time around, we are not going to face relegation worries. Instead, we want to fight to qualify for the Super 6 where everybody will see what we have been able to achieve. “We have seen the teams in our group. We played against them so we have an idea of their strengths and weaknesses and we shall capitalise on them. We want to see how we can break into the first three and qualify for Super 6,” he said. Under Coach Adamu, Wikki Tourists have picked up seven points in two wins, one draw and one loss at Rivers United.
