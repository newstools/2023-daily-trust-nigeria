The former Chairman of Gombe State Sports Commission, Malam Farouk Yarma, has charged Nigeria Premier Football League (NPFL) debutants, Doma United, to stay focused despite the home draw in their opening match of the 2023 NPFL season. One of the two privately owned clubs in the Nigerian topflight, Doma United were forced to a 1-1 draw last Sunday by Sunshine Stars in the Week One match played at the Pantami stadium in Gombe. Charles Chibuke scored Doma United’s first goal in the NPFL in the 38th minute but Sunshine Stars’ Ibrahim Yusuf equalised at the death for a share of the spoils. A mammoth crowd had thronged the Pantami stadium to watch how Doma United would make history by winning their first match in the NPFL but that didn’t happen. However, Yarma who served as Commissioner for Youth Empowerment in Gombe State said Doma United and their teeming fans should be proud of what they were able to achieve against the more illustrious Sunshine Stars. According to him, the league is a marathon so true fans of Doma United should remain resolute in their support for the club. “I understand how you feel after drawing your first match in the Premier League at home to Sunshine Stars. if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[250,250],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_3',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');“I want to urge you to remain resolute. The league season has just started. You have a good team so if you stay focused, you will surely go places. “To the fans, maintain your support. No team can excel without the backing of the supporters. Your support matters a lot to the success of the club,” said Yarma.
