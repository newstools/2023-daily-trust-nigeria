Barcelona’s El Clasico plans have been shattered by the news that Robert Lewandowski will miss the first leg of the Copa del Rey against Real Madrid. The club announced via Twitter that Lewandowski had succumbed to a hamstring strain that will keep him out at least for the next few games. Lewandowski might take anything from a few days to a few weeks to recover from a hamstring injury, meaning that he will definitely be out of contention for Barcelona in the Copa del Rey when they visit the Bernabeu. He will be a big miss for Barcelona, as he is currently the team’s top scorer with 25 goals in all competitions this season.
