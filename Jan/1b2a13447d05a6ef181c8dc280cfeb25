The Faculty of Management Sciences, Bayero University Kano (BUK), says it is set to host the 3rd international conference and doctoral colloquium on sustainable transformation of public and corporate management in the digital age to view perspectives, challenges and prospects. The Dean, Faculty of Management Sciences, Prof. Kabir Tahir Hamid, made this known while briefing journalists at the faculty on Sunday. He said the conference would witness a multidisciplinary approach because technology was dramatically transforming every aspect of life, thereby bringing about a radical rethink of long-entrenched ways of doing things and traditional paths to development. â€œTechnology has become a critical success factor, and modern public and business organisations should see it as an integral part of their strategy, if they are to thrive. Hamid added that the three-day conference would be held January 10-12, with presentations by dignitaries.
