A male hawker was on Thursday crushed by a truck at the Kara end of the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway in Lagos. The accident came barely 12 days after a containerised truck fell and killed seven persons, including a mother and her child, at the Ojuegba end of Lagos. It was learnt that the truck’s driver lost control as a result of brake failure and the car rammed into four private cars before running over the hawker around 7am and that the driver and his motor boy ran away. The Head of LASTMA (Zebra) at Ojodu- Berger, Mabunmi Oluwa-biyi Abisola, who led a rescue team, said a male hawker by the side of the road died instantly in the accident. He said, “The corpse of the hawker and several others rescued by LASTMA personnel were handed over to medical personnel at the scene of the accident.
