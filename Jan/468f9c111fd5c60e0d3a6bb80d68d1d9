The Kano command of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), has urged petroleum marketers in the state to report activities of extortionists claiming to be personnel of the Corps. A statement by the commandâ€™s Public Relations Officer, DSC Ibrahim Idris Abdullahi, said that its attention has been drawn to the activities of some unscrupulous elements, who out of sheer greed and criminality, are extorting money from petroleum marketers and some filling stations in the state, stressing that such criminally minded elements are fake civil defenders and can never be the staff of the Corps.
