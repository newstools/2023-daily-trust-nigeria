Naira: CBN’s non-compliance with S/Court verdict contemptuous – Yadudu, Falana Naira scarcity: Traders reduce prices of goods for cash payment Olalomi Amole and Komolafe Olaiya had ended their Saturday morning programme Oyin Adun abruptly 20 minutes ahead of time when they received call of the medical emergency of Baba Bintin. Scarcity of cash as a result of naira redesign policy of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has triggered nationwide outrage. The CBN had redesigned N200, N500 and N1000 and phased the old notes out of circulation, but some governors had approached the Supreme Court to challenge the apex bank’s action. Following the court ruling on old notes, President Muhammadu Buhari ordered that only N200 old notes should remain legal tender. However, the court later ruled that old N500 and N1000 notes should remain legal tender till December. But the Federal Government is yet to comply with the order. While some commercial banks have been giving out old notes, they have refused to accept them as deposit from customers.
