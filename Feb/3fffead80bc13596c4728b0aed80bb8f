The mother of a pupil, Michael, Mrs Kehinde Adebanjo, has reacted after her son was flogged by a teacher at Kiddies Land Academy for coming late to school in Kubwa in Bwari Area Council of the FCT. She told our reporter that, “I was surprised when my son got home and told me that his aunt beat him to the extent that he had bruises all over his body. He explained to her that if there was cash, he would have boarded an Okada as usual. I will visit the school tomorrow.” But, speaking with our reporter via telephone, the teacher (name withheld) said Michael was used to going to school late. She said, “When he told me he trekked from home because of naira scarcity, I didn’t believe because he’s always late to school. I didn’t know the cane I used would injure him like that.”
