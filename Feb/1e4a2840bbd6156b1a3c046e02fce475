Lobi Stars new goal scoring sensation, Suur Kumaga, is presently on cloud nine following his exploits in his debut season in the Nigeria Premier Football League (NPFL). The youngster who is one of the players scouted by Lobi Stars during their pre-season playing tour of Benue State has scored four goals so far in the Nigerian topflight. Kumaga scored his first league goal in the 1-0 win at Abia Warriors, and then bagged a brace in the 3-0 thumping of Bayelsa United before scoring his fourth goal of the season in the 2-1 win over Dakkada FC. Speaking to Daily Trust yesterday, the attacking winger who said he had moulded his game after former Chelsea player, Eden Hazard, maintained that he still finds it hard to believe that he is already playing in the NPFL. He reiterated a few months ago, he was playing local football in his home town of Konshisha in Benue State but God used the vice-chairman of Lobi Stars, Dominic Iorfa, to lift him from obscurity to prominence. “If I tell you that I am not pleasantly surprised, I will be lying. Honestly, what I have achieved is surprising to me. It’s like a sweet dream. A few months ago, I was playing local football but today I am one of the leading goalscorers in the Nigerian topflight. Isn’t God wonderful? “I have set a modest and realistic target of eight to 10 goals for myself because this is not going to be a full season. The league is abridged so we are playing fewer matches. That notwithstanding, I know that if I keep working hard, I will meet my target. I pray for an injury free season for myself and my teammates,” said Kumaga.
