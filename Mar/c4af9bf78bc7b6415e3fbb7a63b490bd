The Ogun State Commissioner of Police (CP), Frank Mba, has commended the people of the state for their peaceful conduct during the presidential and National Assembly elections. Mr Mba made the commendation in a statement issued on Tuesday by SP Abimbola Oyeyemi, spokesman of the command. He expressed satisfaction with the manner in which the people conducted themselves during the elections and enjoined them to sustain the tempo during the forthcoming gubernatorial and Houses of Assembly elections on March 11. Mba used the opportunity to debunk a video circulating on social media showing a riotous situation somewhere on Borno Way. He said, “There is no place known as Borno Way anywhere in Ogun State, and no riot took place in any part of Ogun State since the conclusion of the elections. “Members of the public are therefore advised to disregard the video and go about their lawful businesses as the police are fully on ground to ensure their safety.” (NAN)
