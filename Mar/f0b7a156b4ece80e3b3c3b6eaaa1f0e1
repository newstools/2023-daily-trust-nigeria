An estimated 135 million people have ear and hearing problems in Africa, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has said. The WHO Regional Director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti noted this yesterday in her statement to mark this year’s World Hearing Day. The theme of this year’s commemoration is: “Ear and hearing care for all! Let’s make it a reality.” She stated that at the current rate, it is likely that by 2050 there could be over 338 million people affected by ear and hearing issues in Africa.

She also stated that globally, over 1.5 billion people live with ear problems and hearing loss, with nearly 80 per cent living in low-and middle-income countries. Dr Moeti said many people with hearing loss did not know how and where to find help or do not have access to the needed services, adding that  this greatly impacts on the lives of those affected, their families, and their communities. The WHO regional boss  enjoined governments to prioritise ear and hearing care health programmes as part of their non-communicable diseases and universal health care agendas and increase their campaign, political and financial commitment.
