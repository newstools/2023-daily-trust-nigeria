The FCT Administration has sensitised residents of Garki, and Wuse districts of Abuja on the need to eschew violence and other vices that can hinder free and fair poll tomorrow. The week-long exercise, which commenced Monday, seeks to awaken the consciousness of residents on peaceful and orderly conduct before, during and after the polls. The Director, FCT Department of Information and Communications Mr. Sule Hazat, who spoke through Deputy Director, Public Enlightenment in the Department, Mrs. Josie Mudasiru, notated that the exercise was imperative for a successful poll. His words: “What we have come here to do is to appeal to the people to go and cast their votes on Saturday in a peaceful and orderly manner. “There is every need for residents to eschew arguments and quarrels that could trigger violence, which undermines, smooth conduct of elections. “As Nigerians, we must comport ourselves in an orderly and decent manner. Cast your vote quietly for candidates of your choice, without being compelled to, and refrain from compelling others. “If you must wait for votes to be counted, then endeavour to stay at a safe distance.  Let us all remember that after this election, we will still be together and there will still be one Nigeria.”
