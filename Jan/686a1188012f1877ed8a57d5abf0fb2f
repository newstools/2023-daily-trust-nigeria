The Road Transport Employers Association of Nigeria (RTEAN) in Ogun State has bemoaned the recent clash among motorists in the state, describing it as unacceptable. Our correspondent had reported a clash between rival unions at the annual Itori Day, in which many were injured in the presence of Governor Dapo Abiodun. The Secretary of RTEAN in the state, Tiwalade Akingbade, told newsmen in Abeokuta that the peaceful atmosphere being enjoyed in the last four years by motorists had been truncated. He particularly warned the chairman of the state parks management (OGSPAM), Akeem Bodunrin, popularly known as Iyeru and other union leaders not to set the state on fire following the resurgence of clashes. The body also accused Iyeru of launching an attack against its chairman, Akibu Titilayo, aka Efele. “We are informing all the security agencies, the police, DSS, NSCDC, Amotekun, So-Safe and others, the state government and the general public that we, at the Road Transport Employers’ Association of Nigeria (RTEAN), would not sit idly, fold our arms and receive violent attacks from lyeru and the hooligans,” he declared. While calling on Iyeru to support what he called the decision of the state government, Akingbade advised him “not to allow himself to be used by the opposition party to create a state of panic and violence in Ogun State,” especially as the elections are here. if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[336,280],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_3',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');Reacting, Iyeru debunked all the allegations, saying the RTEAN members were only trying to be smart by being the first to address the press. Speaking through his vice chairman, Jimoh Olatunbosun Ajagbe, Iyeru said the clash at Itori had nothing to do with him, saying he was never in possession of any gun, let alone shooting anybody.
