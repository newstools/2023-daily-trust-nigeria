Later tonight, a lot of people in the world would be glued to their television screens and internet-enabled devices as they watch the 2023 Oscars Awards. For Nigerians, the 95th Academy Awards may be a remarkable one as one of our talented stars, Temilade Openiyi, is a nominee at the award ceremony. The songstress was nominated for the 2023 edition of the Oscars in the category of Best Original Song based on a collaboration she had on the song, “Lift Me Up” with superstar Barbadian singer, Rihanna; music producer, Ludwig Göransson; and Black Panther’s director, Ryan Coogler. It should be known that it is sketchy if Tems will also become an Oscar award winner should Rihanna eventually clinch the award in the category even though its nominees’ list, has Tems as one of those who contributed to the “music and lyrics” of the project.

It further stated, “Expressly excluded from eligibility are all of the following: partial contributors (i.e., any writer not responsible for the overall design of the work), contributors working on speculation, producers and/or arrangers not responsible for the creation of the original song or score music supervisors,” it added. While Tems indeed co-wrote ‘Lift Me Up’ with Rihanna, her quota for the project remains unknown. This feat from the Damages singer comes shortly after she became the first Nigerian female artiste to clinch a Grammy award due to her collaborative effort with American rapper, Future and Canadian superstar, Drake, on the song, Wait For U.
