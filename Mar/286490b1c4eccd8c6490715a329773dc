 Two members of a syndicate who specialise in producing fake vehicle import documents have been arrested at the Idiroko border in Ogun State. The suspects are among 18 others arrested by customs operatives from the Federal Operations Unit (FOU), Zone A, in the month of February, 2023, for their alleged involvement in unpatriotic activities that involve the importation or exportation of goods through unlawful means with the objective to evade customs duties and taxes. Acting Controller of FOU, Zone A, Hussein Kehinde Ejibunu, who paraded the fraudsters, said their arrest was in continuation of the unit’s onslaught against smuggling and economic saboteurs. He noted that the unit made a major breakthrough in the bursting and arrest of the two-man syndicate that forged customs clearing documents with which they smuggled vehicles into the country. He said, “Items recovered from the suspects in the course of arrest and investigation are a fake customs valuation stamp, fake customs duty chart book on vehicles, fake customs documents and vehicle registration documents, four computer monitors and three computer processing units, one keyboard and one printer.”
