The Chief Coach of Wikki Tourists, Abdullahi Adamu, has expressed satisfaction with the 0-0 draw against Plateau United in a friendly match played Sunday at the New Jos Stadium. The young gaffer said the performance of his boys was an indication of what should be expected from the ‘Bauchi elephants’ in the 2023 Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) season which resumed yesterday in Uyo. He, however, said the initial plan was a win to round up their preparations for the opening match of the season against Niger Tornadoes. “What we planned for was to come and win the match but it’s still not bad as the match has given an insight into what our supporters should expect in the 2023 season” said Abdullahi. He also commended his players for playing to instructions against the highly rated Plateau United boys. On the postponement of some matches in the current NPFL season to next week, Abdullahi said it will give Wikki Tourists more time to further fine tune their strategies for the challenges ahead. It will be recalled that Wikki Tourists had beaten Plateau United by 4-1 in Bauchi in the first leg of the friendly matches. if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[468,60],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_3',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');The ‘Bauchi elephants’ as WIkki Tourists are known will be opening their campaign in the 2022/2023 NPFL season against Niger Tornadoes on Sunday, January 15 in Bauchi.
