English professional boxer of Nigerian descent Anthony Joshua has stated that he is in for a serious fight against American Jermaine Franklin. The 33-year-old Joshua was on top of the heavyweight division for five years. He explained in a recent interview that he finds it difficult to believe that the IBF, IBO, WBA, and WBO world heavyweight titles are no longer in his possession. Joshua was defeated by Ukrainian Oleksandr Usyk in back-to-back fights. It was a unanimous decision loss in the first fight at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London.

However, in the recent chat with reporters, Joshua admitted that he has ambition to return to the apex of the division. “I’m serious, focused, locked in. It’s a serious fight, good opponent, I respect all of my opponents.” “If he had the belts I would take him the same way. He’s a fighter,” he said. He is now on the hunt to become a three-time heavyweight world champion and is not underestimating Franklin. Franklin on the other hand recently made reports that Joshua has avoided WBC heavyweight champion Tyson Fury and American boxing superstar Deontay Wilder. Joshua will return to the ring against Franklin at the O2 Arena in London on Saturday, April 1, 2023.
