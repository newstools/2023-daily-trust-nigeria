The Police Spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed the incident, describing it as a “natural death.” “A police officer went on duty, he slept and he couldn’t wake up in the morning. “It is a case of sudden and unnatural death. It is not something that is beyond the ordinary. It is not something that has not happened before. Anybody can be sick and die anywhere, even in your house,” he said. Bankole was transferred from the Ogun State police command and was replaced by former Force Public Relations Officer, Frank Mba, barely a month ago.
