Eight-time Nigeria Professional Football League champions, Enyimba have began the 2022/23 abridged season with a 2-1 win over Nasarawa United at the Zaria Road stadium, Jos yesterday. The Elephants kicked off the game with a blistering start that saw Abubakar threatening with a strike that narrowly went over in the first minute. In the 25th minute, Nasarawa had a rare chance as Dennis Victor floated in a cross as Josiah Oche noded down to Maigishiri whose volley went off target. Keen to make amends after a rather poor performance last season, Enyimba got the opener in the 32nd minute through Elijah Akanni who scored an absolute beauty from outside of the box. Buoyed by the goal, the Finidi-George side doubled the lead six minutes later as Imoh Obot scored with a thunderous freekick that left the Nasarawa keeper, David Yinka stunned. Fully in control of the game, Enyimba gave little or no space for their hosts to make any meaningful threat to their goal area but their resilience was tested as the game went in the second half. In the 77th minute, Enyimba keeper, Ojo Olorunleke was finally tested as he pulled a top save to keep out a goal bound freekick but he was finally breached after Nasarawa Utd was awarded a penalty in the 87th minute. Ojo had initially saved the penalty but the rebound was headed in by Oche Josiah. The hosts, Nasarawa United pressured EnyimbaÂ  at closing stages but the Elephants defended well to repel everything thrown at them to end the game 2-1.
