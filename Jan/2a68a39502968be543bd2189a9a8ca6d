Bendel Insurance and Plateau United’s games on Nigeria Professional Football League matchday two have been moved to Thursday, January 19, by the Interim Management Committee (IMC). The game, which was initially scheduled for January 18, will now take place at Benin City’s well-known Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium at 4 p.m. The matchup change is due to logistical issues that Plateau United experienced after their play against Shooting Stars on matchday one in Jos on Sunday. Meanwhile, Enyimba International FC player, Elijah Akanni, has said his dream for this season is helping his club achieve their target of becoming the winner of the league and also gaining a continental ticket. Akanni who opened the goal-scoring account for his club during their match against Nasarawa United Fc during the NPFL matchday one played at New Jos International Stadium which ended 1-2 in the favour of  the visitors, expressed that he was delighted to score his first goal for the club. “I feel delighted and I feel so great because I have always wanted to be a leading star in my team and to help the team get a good result, I am so happy for the goal because it is my first goal for Enyimba . My dream for the club is to become the champions and play in the CAF champions league,” he said.  By Jide Olusola and Dotun Omisakin, Lagos
