The flourishing career of a Nigerian table tennis star, Bose Odusanya, who has won the Molade Okoya-Thomas Table Tennis championship for eight years consecutively, has come under threat following an undisclosed ailment. Odusanya who enjoyed an easy ride to claim her 8th Okya-Thomas table tennis title, after overpowering Aanu Anjuwon, 4-0 in the final played last Friday, has disclosed to Daily Trust that her decision to temporarily stay off the sport was based on health challenges. She said “I didn’t want to participate because I am not feeling fine. So, I have decided to stop playing table tennis for now because of my health condition,” said Bose. The champion, who broke 46 years record held by Dele Olasunmbo who had won the men singles title for seven times consecutively from 1969-1976, revealed that it was her husband that encouraged her to compete in the just concluded tourney. Daily Trust gathered that the table tennis star recently got married to the man who doubles as her coach. She said “His support is enormous. I didn’t want to feature in this competition but my husband encouraged me to play and to win.” She also said her dominance in the 54 year-old annual table tennis championship has been by the grace of God.
