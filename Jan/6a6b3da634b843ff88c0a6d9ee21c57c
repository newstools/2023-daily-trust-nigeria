The Labour Party (LP) senatorial candidate for the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Hajiya Ireti Kingibe, has described herself as a true symbol of the nation’s capital who will represent everyone’s interest if elected. She was speaking at an appeal fund launching on youths’ skills acquisition organised by the FCT Hausa/Fulani Development Association (FULHAUJ) on Sunday in Abuja. Ireti noted that with a Muslim father who hailed from Panshekara in Kano State who had Yoruba blood, as well as a Christian mother of Igbo extraction, she could be described as a true Nigerian that all voters in the territory should rally behind. Speaking earlier, the leader of FULHAUJ, Alhaji Aminu Lawan Bakin-Ruwa, pledged to channel the money realised into a planned skills acquisition centre where about 20 youths would be selected from each of the six FCT area councils for training annually. City & Crime reports that over N4m was realised at the event.
