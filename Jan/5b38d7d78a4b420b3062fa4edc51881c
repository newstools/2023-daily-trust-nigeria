The chairman of Kuje Area Council in the FCT, Abdullahi Suleiman Sabo, has said the ongoing strike by the primary school teachers in the area was not his making but caused by arbitrary recruitment of teachers by the previous administration in 2018. City & Crime had reported that primary school teachers under the branch of the Nigeria Union of Teachers (NUT) led by Comrade Lucky Audu, had last Monday, declared indefinite strike over non-payment of salaries of those employed in 2018, non-payments of arrears and among others. Sabo, who spoke exclusively with our reporter on Monday, while reacting to the strike, said there were lots of abnormalities during the employment of some the teachers by the previous administration in 2018. He said the previous administration employed unqualified teachers without cash backing, adding that the vacancy that was declared for recruitment of primary school teachers was only 90, but the administration employed over 1,000 without any budgetary provisions.
