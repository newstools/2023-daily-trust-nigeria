A report says unless an urgent action is taken, 25 million Nigerians are at the risk of hunger between June and August 2023. The report, by the Cadre Harmonis√©, a government-led and United Nations-supported food and nutrition analysis, cited continued conflict, climate change, inflation and rising food prices. According to a joint statement yesterday by FAO-UNICEF-OCHA, this is a projected increase from the estimated 17 million people currently at risk of food insecurity. The statement noted that food access has been affected by persistent violence in the northeastern states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe as well as banditry and kidnapping in Katsina, Sokoto, Kaduna, Benue and Niger States. The statement said the National Emergency Management Agency had reported that widespread flooding in the 2022 rainy season damaged over 676,000 hectares of farmlands, which diminished harvests and increased the risk of food insecurity for families across Nigeria.
