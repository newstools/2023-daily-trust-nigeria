Governorship candidate of Labour Party in Kano State, Bashir Ishaq Bashir, met with Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, Presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), on Sunday evening. Sources told Daily Trust that the meeting held in Abuja and discussions around defection held. However, Bashir has neither officially announced his defection from LP nor stated whether he would abandon his gubernatorial ambition or not. Though the outcome of the meeting is not yet known, it is coming barely two weeks after the gubernatorial candidate led other party leaders in Kano boycotted the rally of LP presidential candidate, Peter Obi, in Kano.
