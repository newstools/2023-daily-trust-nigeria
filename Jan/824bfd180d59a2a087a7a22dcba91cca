Kwara, Monday March 7:  An old scooter abandoned along Pakata Road, Ilorin, threw residents of the community into panic, our correspondent learnt on Sunday. It was gathered that the white Vespa, which was parked in front of Agbobamu’s compound, had no registration number and had been there for over a week with nobody coming to claim ownership or make an inquiry about it. Speaking on the development, a resident, Alhaji Ibrahim Agbobamu, said they woke up and saw the “strange” machine. According to him, “We woke up to discover the scooter right in front of our compound last Monday morning. Initially, we assumed the owner might have run out of fuel and had gone in search of it. “But after we didn’t hear anything of such for a whole day, our concern became suspicion and then grew into fear. This was since a week ago now. “What could be the motive behind such action, especially in this era of insecurity where anything and everything of such is a potential danger and dangerously implicative,’’ he said. He said they had reported the matter to the Adewole police division but no action has been taken. if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[250,250],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_3',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');Also, another resident, Muhammad Isa, said they now sleep in fear because of the development. “We slept late on the previous Saturday only to wake up to discover it on Sunday morning. Our environment security wise is too fragile not to be concerned with such development now. “Imagine the police at Adewole telling us that they don’t have fuel to come and do the needful, leaving the residents they are supposed to protect in fear,” he added. When contacted on Sunday, the spokesman of the Kwara State Police Command, Ajayi Okasanmi, said the matter had not been brought to his attention.
