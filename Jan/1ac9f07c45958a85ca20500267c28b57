The leadership of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) will be having an emergency meeting with the 43 clubs in the Nigeria National League (NNL) today at the football federation’s secretariat in Abuja. Head of Operations of the NNL, Emmanuel Adesanya, who disclosed this in a statement, said the meeting is in continuation of the new NFF president, Ibrahim Musa Gusau’s parley with the various leagues. It will be recalled that it took the quick intervention of the NFF boss for the 2023 Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) season to commence. Following unresolved issues over the abridged league format as proposed by the Interim Management Committee, the NFF president met with the clubs where all contentious issues were settled for the league to resume. Therefore, Adesanya said part of the reasons for today’s emergency meeting which he said was necessitated by “unforeseen circumstances” is to prepare grounds for the kick-off of the second tier league. While regretting the inconveniences the impromptu nature of the notice would cause the clubs, he appealed for their understanding as he maintained that it is compulsory for all the 43 NNL clubs to be in attendance. Katsina United and former Nigerian champions, Kano Pillars are among the 43 clubs that will be vying to return to the Nigerian topflight when the NNL eventually resumes.
