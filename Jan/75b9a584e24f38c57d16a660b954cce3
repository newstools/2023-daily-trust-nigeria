There was fear and apprehension among the residents of Ika village in Ibaji LGA of Kogi State when strange men wielding weapons invaded the community. City & Crime reports that Ika village shares border with Anambra West LGA, Anambra State, with its headquarters at Nzam. A resident, Iboyi Uchola, said the strange men came into the town about two weeks ago on a Monday evening in a truck. He said, “We saw them about two weeks ago; all carrying weapons. We don’t know their mission. After a few days in our land, the group disappeared, only for them to return in the same way they entered the town earlier and disappear again.
