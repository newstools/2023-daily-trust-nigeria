The Department of State Services (DSS) has reportedly arrested Doyin Okupe, former Director-General of the Labour Party’s Presidential Campaign Council. According to Tolu Babaleye, a lawyer to Okupe, the politician was arrested at Murtala Muhammed Airport in Ikeja, Lagos State, while on his way to London for medical treatment. A Federal High Court in Abuja had convicted Okupe, a former Special Adviser to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan on Public Affairs, over the diversion of arms funds from the Office of the National Security Adviser. Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu held that the prosecution made out a case of money laundering against Okupe and awarded the total sum of N13m in fines against him.

Justice Ojukwu convicted Okupe in 26 out of the 59-count charges preferred against him by the EFCC. The judge further slammed a sentence of two years for each of the 26 counts to run concurrently or an option of N500,000 fine for each. The judge further ordered that where the fine was not paid within hours, Okupe would be sent to jail and he was said to have paid the fine to avoid being jailed. According to Babaleye, the secret police asked Okupe to provide court processes where he paid the fine option following his money laundering conviction. The DSS is yet to comment on the lawyer’s claim. Okupe had stepped down as the lead campaigner of Peter Obi after the conviction while Akin Osuntokun, a former aide of ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo took over.
