The presidential candidate of the Action Democratic Party (ADP), Engr Yabaji Yusuf Sani, has berated the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC) for allegedly taking Nigeria backward since democracy returned in 1999. In his New Year message yesterday, Sani urged Nigerians to reject the candidates of the two parties at the forthcoming elections, saying they have dashed the hopes of the people. He said, “Nigerians were excited at the return of democracy in 1999, hoping that the new dawn would usher in freedom, peace, development and prosperity. “However, it has turned out to be an era of impunity, recklessness and retrogression. Not much difference has been made from the time of the adventurists who usurped power through the barrel of the gun. “The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the contraption known as the All Progressives Congress (APC) are squarely and pointedly to blame for the unprecedented calamity that has befallen the country within the period. “In between them, like in a relay race, they have been exchanging the baton of leadership and sharing the national resources as booties of war by a rampaging army in a war of attrition.”
