The Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola was furious following another poor display from his team as they suffered another setback in the title race. The champions slumped to their second consecutive defeat in four days after they were surprisingly dumped out of the EFL Cup by Southampton on Wednesday night before surrendering their lead against Manchester United yesterday afternoon. Speaking after the match at full-time, a visibly frustrated Guardiola appeared to concede defeat in his team’s quest to retain the league title. ‘I don’t care about the Premier League and the Carabao Cup, we cannot win. We won a lot, so it’s not a problem.’ he was quoted to have said via BT Sport. The 51-year-old Spaniard was also seemingly frustrated with United’s controversial equaliser. Fernandes fired home after Rashford stepped aside to allow his teammate through, before a host of City players protested instantly to referee Stuart Atwell who gave the goal after a VAR ruling, having initially ruled it out for offside. ‘Well, Rashford is off-side, Bruno Fernandes is not. Whether Rashford intervened and distracted our keeper and our central defenders, I don’t know. The rule is the rule.’ Guardiola was quoted to gave said. The result now leaves Man City five points adrift of Arsenal, who could extend their lead if they beat Spurs in the North London derby tomorrow. On the other hand, United, are only a point adrift of their local rivals in third with both legs firmly in the title race.
