A diaspora-based Yoruba socio-cultural organisation, Yoruba Global Council, has endorsed the candidacy of the All Progressives Congress (APC) flag bearer, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, for Saturday’s presidential election. The spokesman of the council, Professor Lere Amusan, and General Secretary, Prince Segun Akanni, stated that it had become imperative for Yoruba sons and daughters to rally round Tinubu for victory at the poll given the wrong speculations and misconceptions being expressed in certain quarters about Tinubu’s personality. According to the group, the 2023 general election “presents another unique opportunity for the Yoruba race and nation to get it right and avoid a repeat of what transpired in 1963 and 1993 when our two illustrious Yoruba sons, Chief Obafemi Awolowo and Chief Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola, respectively, were denied the presidency on account of tribal enmity and lack of unity.” “The electoral Waterloo that befell the Yoruba nation then must not be allowed to befall us again,” the group said. In a statement, the council said, “Tinubu only, among the top three candidates for the February 25 presidential election, possesses the required standard in education, exposure and experience to move Nigerians out her present challenges and provide Nigerians a new lease of life in line with his campaign slogan, ‘Renewed Hope.” YGC said it is throwing its support behind Tinubu in line with its core mandate of protecting the interest and advancing the course and aspiration of Yoruba sons and daughters in any field. Insisting that it is now the turn of the South, the group said, “Asiwaju Tinubu may not be the only candidate from the South contesting for the exalted office, but he is the most qualified, most capable, most competent and most experienced of all the presidential candidates.”
