Nigeria’s sole representative in the CAF Confederation Cup, Rivers United will today seek its first win in the competition. The Nigerian league champions began their participation in Africa’s second-tier football club competition on a poor note as Congolese side Diables Noirs put three unreplied goals past Stanley Eguma side last week at the Stade Alphonse Massemba-Débat. Rivers United who are currently sitting in the last place in Group B will seek to win this game against Cote d’Ivoire ASEC Mimosas at the Godswill Akpabio International Stadium (Nest of Champions) so as to bring smiles to the faces of their fans and revive their chances of qualifying from the group to the knockout stage. The Ivorian side arrived in Nigeria on Thursday and had their first training on Friday while intensifying their preparation on Saturday  morning.

The Pride of Rivers qualified for the group stages of the competition last November, after defeating Libya’s Al Nasr Benghazi 6-1 on aggregate in the qualification playoffs. The ousters of Remo Stars, Kwara United and Plateau United during the qualification series meant that Rivers United are the only Nigerian club side left on the continent this season. The Pride of Rivers will be the first Nigerian team to achieve the feat should they win the title. The only Nigerian team that has come close is the now-defunct Dolphins, who reached the finals of the 2005 edition but were defeated by Morocco’s FAR Rabat. The current prize money for the CAF Confederation Cup winners stands at $1.25 million, with the runner-up in line to bag $625,000, and semi-finalists, $450,000. Teams that get knocked out in the quarterfinals will get $350,000.
