The Minister of State for Transportation, Prince Ademola Adewole Adegoroye, has said the federal government is committed to entrenching an efficient freight forwarding system in the country. He stated this in Kano State at the commissioning of the Kano Zonal Office of the Council for the Regulation of Freight Forwarding in Nigeria (CRFFN), a statement by Henshaw Ogubike, the Director, Press and Public Relations, said. Prince Adegoroye noted that the construction and commissioning of the CRFFN’s Kano Zonal Office were in furtherance of the federal government’s vision and determination to establish a smooth operating freight forwarding system in the country and expand the participation of littoral and non-littoral states in maritime and general logistics. “The need to promote professionalism, entrench global best practices and develop the capacity of freight forwarding practitioners cannot be overemphasised, hence the policy of having zonal offices in the six geopolitical zones of the country,” the minister said. The CRFFN’s Kano Zonal Office is to oversee the council’s affairs in all 19 northern states and ensure a strong presence of the council in the region. Freight forwarding is the coordination and shipment of goods from one place to another through single or multiple carriers such as air, marine, rail or highways. The minister, while enumerating the anticipated benefits and impacts of the CRFFN’s Kano Zonal Office, expressed optimism that the new office will further encourage the safe, timely, sustainable and environmentally friendly movement of cargo using the road and rail modes. if(typeof ez_ad_units != 'undefined'){ez_ad_units.push([[336,280],'dailytrust_com-box-4','ezslot_3',151,'0','0'])};__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-dailytrust_com-box-4-0');He pointed out that the office would aid revenue generation for the government through the collection of Practitioners’ Operating Fees (POF).
