The Council of Retired Federal Permanent Secretaries (CORFEPS) has asked political parties and their candidates to accept the results of the February 25 and March 11 elections that would be declared by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). A statement yesterday by the council’s chairman, vice chairman and publicity secretary, Yayale Ahmed, Engr Ebele Okeke and Goke Adegoroye, respectively, also asked security agents and the INEC to provide a level-playing field for all parties in the elections. The council called on all Nigerians to eschew violence and deploy their patriotic understanding to embrace the results declared by INEC. “Recognising that the confidence of the populace and, indeed, of the political parties themselves in accepting the results of the election is contingent on the integrity of the electoral processes, we call on INEC to, at all levels of its operations, live up to the expectation of Nigerians and the international community as a truly independent entity, immune to the extraneous influences of agents of either the political parties or the sitting administrations, whether in physical forms or through remote cyber hacking challenges.
