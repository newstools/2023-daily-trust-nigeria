 Ahead of the February 25 and March 11 general elections, a group of loyalists of the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Mr Peter Obi, has developed a mobile app named “Structured Media” to help voters locate their Polling Units (PUs) on election days. The Director of the organisation, a UK-based lawyer, Emmanuel Awulonu, on Sunday in Abuja, said the development of the app was to change the view that Obi lacked “political structure” to win this year’s presidential election. He explained that in the bid to spread the LP’s sphere of influence across the country, especially during the elections, the app was developed in conjunction with other young Nigerians to be a game changer as far as Nigeria’s electoral process was concerned. He said, “This feat was achieved after 15 screening exercises where the app came out tops from the over 28 others presented to the LP Presidential Campaign Council (PCC).” He added that the app had been officially recognised by Mr Obi who had tweeted it out to Nigerians, urging them to download it.
