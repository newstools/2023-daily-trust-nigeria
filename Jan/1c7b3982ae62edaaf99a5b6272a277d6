President Muhammadu Buhari has assured that Nigeria will support Republic of Burundi in diverse ways as necessary in the spirit of African solidarity and brotherliness. The President gave the assurance Tuesday at State House, Abuja, while receiving the Special Envoy of President Evariste Ndayishimiye, who came with a message. On request for assistance in the area of energy provision, particularly fuel, by the Burundi leader, President Buhari said he knows what it feels like for a country to suffer from energy shortage, and promised that he would get the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited to look into the request. Burundi’s request is coming at a period Nigeria is battling fuel scarcity which started in December 2022. While the situation is gradually improving, many filling stations are selling above the pump price. The President, in a statement issued by his spokesman, Femi Adesina, said he was looking forward to the polls, and retirement, since he had satisfied the constitutionally required two terms to be in office.
