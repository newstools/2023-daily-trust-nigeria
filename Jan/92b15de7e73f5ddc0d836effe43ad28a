Less than a week after the presidential candidate of the New Nigerian People Party (NNPP), Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, visited Bauchi State, the party’s Northeast coordinator, Dr Babayo Liman and hundreds of supporters have defected to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state. The decampees, at the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) secretariat yesterday, in Bauchi, declared their support to the PDP presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar. Liman said he believed in Atiku’s capacity to salvage the country from its present hardship and dwindling economy considering his antecedents as a former vice president for eight years. He said, “I am here at the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) Bauchi State branch to inform the press and the general public that today, I Babayo Liman, has resigned my appointments as National Zonal Secretary, member of presidential campaign council, coordinator of Kwankwasiyya and membership from the party. “I am here with some of my executive members and thousands of supporters to declare our intention to join the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and to support the candidacy of Alhaji Atiku Abubakar as president of Nigeria and Bala Mohammed as governor of Bauchi State, respectively. “I’m calling on all my supporters in the entire North East to follow my steps to decamp from the NNPP to the PDP, and also call on my supporters in Bauchi State to do the same.”
