Lewis Hamilton says he had bananas thrown at him and was regularly the subject of racial abuse at school. The Mercedes driver, 38, says his school days were “probably the most traumatising and most difficult part of my life”. “I was already being bullied at the age of six. At that particular school, I was one of three kids of colour and just bigger, stronger, bullying kids were throwing me around a lot of the time.” Speaking to the On Purpose podcast, the seven-time Formula 1 champion detailed a number of racially abusive terms that he was referred to at school.
