The Gombe State Police Command has met with the leadership of the Jama’atul Nasril Islam (JNI), Jama’atul Izalatil Bidi’a Wa Ikamatul Sunnah (JIBWIS) and the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), ahead of the Saturday’s governorship and houses of assembly elections. At the meeting, the state Commissioner of Police, Mr Oqua Etim, called on the religious leaders to impress on their followers the need to conduct themselves peacefully before, during and after the elections. A statement by the command’s spokesperson, ASP Mahid Mu’azu Abubakar, said the CP represented by DCP Yusuf Mohammed Lawal urged the religious leaders to preach to their adherents against the negative use of social media to spread harmful messages that might lead to unrest or breach of peace. Etim also urged parents to caution their children and wards against engaging in political thuggery. He warned that any individual or group of persons found inciting people on religious divide would be arrested and prosecuted. The CP assured residents of the police commitment to ensure maximum security before, during and after the elections. Responding, the secretary of the JNI, Alhaji Saleh Danburam, promised to continue to preach peace, promote unity among different religions and assured the police of their unfailing support for peace and unity. He also added that religious leaders under the JNI would not be allowed to involve themselves in partisan politics.
