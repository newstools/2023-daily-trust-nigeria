Three children have been burnt to death in the Kinkinau area in Kaduna South LGA of Kaduna State. City & Crime learnt that the incident happened around 1am on Thursday last week when fire razed their house. A neighbour of the victims said, “The victims were children in a family of five and all of them were burnt beyond recognition. They were living with their father and two other children. The victims’ father, Mohammed Tasiu, explained that he stopped some hunters who tried to shoot a cat on the roof of his house that night before he went to bed. He said that while he was inside in bed, he heard a sound on his roof and thought it was the cat that returned but later perceived a strange odour, as if something was burning and so he went into the children’s room to check but saw nothing burning. He further said, “I then went into the compound to check around only to see fire at the back of the rooms, and before I could rush back to save my family, the children’s room was on fire. “I heard them (children) crying inside the room for help but I couldn’t save them despite my effort because of the fire. So, I honestly don’t know what actually caused the fire but Allah knows,” adding that the children had been buried according to Islamic rites.
