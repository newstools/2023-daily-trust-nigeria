The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) has received eight new power transformers at the Apapa Port, Lagos and is set to deploy them to the Bauchi substation and three other states. Daily Trust reports that the company imported over 40 transformers in 2022 which were deployed to various project sites for its power transmission expansion projects. According to a statement on Thursday by the spokesperson of the company, Ndidi Mbah, the consignment comprised six units of 150/187.5MVA transformers operational for 330/132/33 kilovolts (kV) substations and two units of 100/125MVA operational in 132/33kV transmission substations. TCN said the transformers are still at the ports as arrangements were being concluded to move them to project sites across four states. A breakdown of the destinations shows that two of the 150MVA transformers would be delivered to substations in Bauchi; one 150MVA transformer to Mayo Belwa and another to Yola, all in Adamawa State. Two units of 100MVA transformers would also be delivered to the Yola substations to operate on the 132/33kV section.
